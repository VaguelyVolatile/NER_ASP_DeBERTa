i started working out and using the sauna daily. but this started giving me a bad rash under my sports bra where my sweat would collect. i discovered that this can happen especially if you are detoxing or doing lymphatic drainage. tea tree oil was one of the recommended treatments but i also read that a lot of typical body washes leave residue on the skin that can further irritate it and i felt like this was happening. it was giving me really horrible body odor during my workouts especially hot yoga where i was sweating so much. so i decided to try this body wash due to the natural antibacterial properties. it has been a game changer. not only do i feel like i am washing away more of the toxins post workout but the natural oils and tea tree in this seem to have stopped the odor issues i was having completely.i also love that this came in a two pack because i have my son using it now too. he plays many sports but us under 10 and has that little boy body odor after athletics but he has very sensitive skin. this has really helped him too.if you are working out and sweating a lot definitely get this and add it to your post workout shower routine. its awesome and the natural oils are so good for your skin. post workout game changerboob rash reducer,started working using sauna daily . started giving bad rash sports bra sweat would collect . discovered happen especially detoxing lymphatic drainage . tea tree oil one recommended treatments also read lot typical body washes leave residue skin irritate felt like happening . giving really horrible body odor workouts especially hot yoga sweating much . decided try body wash due natural antibacterial properties . game changer . not feel like washing away toxins post workout natural oils tea tree seem stopped odor issues completely.i also love came two pack son using . plays many sports us 10 little boy body odor athletics sensitive skin . really helped too.if working sweating lot definitely get add post workout shower routine . awesome natural oils good skin . post workout game changerboob rash reducer,"['started', 'working', 'using', 'sauna', 'daily', '.', 'started', 'giving', 'bad', 'rash', 'sports', 'bra', 'sweat', 'would', 'collect', '.', 'discovered', 'happen', 'especially', 'detoxing', 'lymphatic', 'drainage', '.', 'tea', 'tree', 'oil', 'one', 'recommended', 'treatments', 'also', 'read', 'lot', 'typical', 'body', 'washes', 'leave', 'residue', 'skin', 'irritate', 'felt', 'like', 'happening', '.', 'giving', 'really', 'horrible', 'body', 'odor', 'workouts', 'especially', 'hot', 'yoga', 'sweating', 'much', '.', 'decided', 'try', 'body', 'wash', 'due', 'natural', 'antibacterial', 'properties', '.', 'game', 'changer', '.', 'not', 'feel', 'like', 'washing', 'away', 'toxins', 'post', 'workout', 'natural', 'oils', 'tea', 'tree', 'seem', 'stopped', 'odor', 'issues', 'completely.i', 'also', 'love', 'came', 'two', 'pack', 'son', 'using', '.', 'plays', 'many', 'sports', 'us', '10', 'little', 'boy', 'body', 'odor', 'athletics', 'sensitive', 'skin', '.', 'really', 'helped', 'too.if', 'working', 'sweating', 'lot', 'definitely', 'get', 'add', 'post', 'workout', 'shower', 'routine', '.', 'awesome', 'natural', 'oils', 'good', 'skin', '.', 'post', 'workout', 'game', 'changerboob', 'rash', 'reducer']"

as a longterm user of this truremedy naturals tea tree body wash i can confidently say its become an essential part of our familys daily routine. the tea tree formula provides a gentle yet effective cleanse without stripping the skin of its natural moisture.what sets this body wash apart is its versatility. while it works perfectly as an everyday cleanser the tea tree oil offers additional therapeutic benefits. the scent is refreshing and clean without being overpowering  a pleasant natural fragrance rather than an artificial one.the consistency is just right  not too thick or too watery  and a little goes a long way. after using it regularly ive noticed it helps keep skin issues at bay while leaving skin feeling clean and comfortable never tight or dry. the 12 oz bottle lasts a reasonable amount of time even with regular use.particularly impressive is how it manages to be both soothing and effective. for anyone looking for a body wash that goes beyond basic cleansing without being harsh on the skin this is an excellent choice. after a couple years of consistent use its earned its permanent spot in our shower.the only minor suggestion would be to offer a larger size option for families who use it frequently but thats hardly a complaint. will definitely continue purchasing this product.prosgentle yet effective cleansingpleasant natural tea tree scentnondrying formulasoothes skin irritationsgreat value for quality perfect everyday body wash with therapeutic benefits,longterm user truremedy naturals tea tree body wash confidently say become essential part familys daily routine . tea tree formula provides gentle yet effective cleanse without stripping skin natural moisture.what sets body wash apart versatility . works perfectly everyday cleanser tea tree oil offers additional therapeutic benefits . scent refreshing clean without overpowering pleasant natural fragrance rather artificial one.the consistency right not thick watery little goes long way . using regularly ive noticed helps keep skin issues bay leaving skin feeling clean comfortable never tight dry . 12 oz bottle lasts reasonable amount time even regular use.particularly impressive manages soothing effective . anyone looking body wash goes beyond basic cleansing without harsh skin excellent choice . couple years consistent use earned permanent spot shower.the minor suggestion would offer larger size option families use frequently thats hardly complaint . definitely continue purchasing product.prosgentle yet effective cleansingpleasant natural tea tree scentnondrying formulasoothes skin irritationsgreat value quality perfect everyday body wash therapeutic benefits,"['longterm', 'user', 'truremedy', 'naturals', 'tea', 'tree', 'body', 'wash', 'confidently', 'say', 'become', 'essential', 'part', 'familys', 'daily', 'routine', '.', 'tea', 'tree', 'formula', 'provides', 'gentle', 'yet', 'effective', 'cleanse', 'without', 'stripping', 'skin', 'natural', 'moisture.what', 'sets', 'body', 'wash', 'apart', 'versatility', '.', 'works', 'perfectly', 'everyday', 'cleanser', 'tea', 'tree', 'oil', 'offers', 'additional', 'therapeutic', 'benefits', '.', 'scent', 'refreshing', 'clean', 'without', 'overpowering', 'pleasant', 'natural', 'fragrance', 'rather', 'artificial', 'one.the', 'consistency', 'right', 'not', 'thick', 'watery', 'little', 'goes', 'long', 'way', '.', 'using', 'regularly', 'ive', 'noticed', 'helps', 'keep', 'skin', 'issues', 'bay', 'leaving', 'skin', 'feeling', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'never', 'tight', 'dry', '.', '12', 'oz', 'bottle', 'lasts', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'time', 'even', 'regular', 'use.particularly', 'impressive', 'manages', 'soothing', 'effective', '.', 'anyone', 'looking', 'body', 'wash', 'goes', 'beyond', 'basic', 'cleansing', 'without', 'harsh', 'skin', 'excellent', 'choice', '.', 'couple', 'years', 'consistent', 'use', 'earned', 'permanent', 'spot', 'shower.the', 'minor', 'suggestion', 'would', 'offer', 'larger', 'size', 'option', 'families', 'use', 'frequently', 'thats', 'hardly', 'complaint', '.', 'definitely', 'continue', 'purchasing', 'product.prosgentle', 'yet', 'effective', 'cleansingpleasant', 'natural', 'tea', 'tree', 'scentnondrying', 'formulasoothes', 'skin', 'irritationsgreat', 'value', 'quality', 'perfect', 'everyday', 'body', 'wash', 'therapeutic', 'benefits']"
i got this because i needed a nice anti bacterial soap and this one came highly reviewed and praised. i can not totally see why as it is really great especially for a bigger guy such as myself.the good nice fresh clean smell and feel. i didnt really get that menthollike feel which is fine because i was actually worried about it being over powering but it actually was fine. ive heard some people say it has a good mint feeling but i didnt honestly get that too much again for me thats a plus.it has a nice smell of mint without being an over powering type of mint. its very subtle in its smell afterwards but it helps stop odors for sure especially for bigger people who have more odor areas and issues like that. this will help with those areas and keep you smelling fresh.it also helps areas if you get a blood boil or raised bumps that could become infected. this stuff is antibacterial so it will help those problem areas stay safe and out of infection territory which isnt a place anyone wants to be. lastly this stuff is packed in a small bottle but a little bit really does go a long way. start out with a little bit on your hand and lather. youll get a decent amount of showers out of it before you have to replace. wish it was a bigger bottle but glad it laststhe bad i dont know if its because i seem to have the most sensitive skin ever or what or maybe its just how the soap is supposed to be it would really take some of the moisture out of the skin which is weird with how much oils are in the product. it could have been simply it was taking some of the bad moisture out because bigger people have that issue and perhaps thats what was happening.not really a big deal just something i noticed. didnt cause any issues. the only other issue i had was that you are really getting a tiny bottle for the price compared to my other soaps. this is definitely one of the more expensive soaps i use which is alright but i wish the price was a little bit lower. thankfully a little bit goes a long way with this stuffoverall this product is an ally especially for bigger people with some skin issues. its not overpowering like some mint products i have seen on the market. i just would have liked to see a more consumer friendly price but i assume inflation didnt help. either way hands down ill buy it again when i run out. seriously a great soap for the bigger people a

i want to start off this review by mentioning that i work in a garage setting. this means im constantly in contact with grease road grime and so many petroleum based lubricants and jellies so the last thing i want touching my skin at the end of the day is another chemical ridden soap. because thats the time of day i really get to relax and feel genuinely clean for the first time that day ive become a little bit of a soap snob. usually i prefer solid soaps for the scent and skin feel but this is the first liquid soap ive really really liked. ive now had this soap for about 5 months now and this is why i love it.  despite being natural it has no problem cutting through grease and grime ive accumulated throughout the day. the scent is also perfect for my taste its subtle but definitely still has presence. i mostly notice the grapefruit and pink himalayan salt with something else i cant put my finger on. anyway its great  also worth mentioning i have sensitive skin. especially on my face i have some almost eczema like patches that can flare up if i dont take care of it. having used this soap through a cold and dry wisconsin winter into a hot and muggy summer i can tell you this has performed very well. i havent needed to add anything else to my skin care routine and the spots on my face have not been inflamed at all since using this soap. its very gentle and moisturizes well.  of course my skin chemistry and work environment isnt going to be the same for everyone but in my experience this soap has more than earned 5 stars in my book. its my new go to and ill be restocking once i get through the bulk sized bag i ordered months ago. i highly recommend the big bags worth of soap best price per volume and less plastic waste  just squirt some into an existing soap bottle for convenience.my only qualm the bag of soap i ordered had some damage from shipping but odds are this was the mailmans doing and not the packaging itself. a small corner that was melted into place for the bags regitity had pulled apart at the seam. note this did not hurt the bags function or cause any leaking whatsoever. just something to check for when you order yours so you can prolong the bags life. coming from a garage tech this soap can handle anything and still leave your skin feeling great.,want start review mentioning work garage setting . means im constantly contact grease road

i have bought this stuff for years and generally like it but really pretty irritated that they dropped their refills from 64 oz down to 48 oz changed the packaging and then kept the price the same as the bigger size.  we know everything has gotten more expensive but the marketing is also intentionally deceptive.  for example the picture they have where they show the 48 oz new and improved version physically larger than the 64 oz version  come on thats just obnoxious.  if youre going to provide less and charge more just own it instead of trying to dupe people with dumb graphics and then hope the rest dont notice.  the larger size was nice simply to not have to order refills as often and likely saved even more packaging waste.  this whole move seems pretty counterproductive which is disappointing considering they were my favorite for many years.  the annoying tactics have led to me look at some other brands just to see what else is out there.  might be back might not be.  the product itself is pretty good for sensitive skin and doesnt leave a residue.  it doesnt foam up as much as other products so you end up using probably 3x more than more typical body washes just as a heads up.  i guess thats the added tax for cleannatural body washes not having certain agents in them to foam up maybe good product lame that they dropped the size from 64 oz to 48 oz and kept the price the same.,bought stuff years generally like really pretty irritated dropped refills 64 oz 48 oz changed packaging kept price bigger size . know everything gotten expensive marketing also intentionally deceptive . example picture show 48 oz new improved version physically larger 64 oz version come thats obnoxious . youre going provide less charge instead trying dupe people dumb graphics hope rest dont notice . larger size nice simply not order refills often likely saved even packaging waste . whole move seems pretty counterproductive disappointing considering favorite many years . annoying tactics led look brands see else . might back might not . product pretty good sensitive skin doesnt leave residue . doesnt foam much products end using probably 3x typical body washes heads . guess thats added tax cleannatural body washes not certain agents foam maybe good product lame dropped size 64 oz 48 oz kept price .,"['bought', 'stuff', 'years', 'generally', 'like', 'really', 'pretty', 'irritated', 'dropped', 'refills', '64', 'oz', '48', 'oz', 'changed', 'packaging', 'kept', 'price', 'bigger', 'size', '.', 'know', 'everything', 'gotten', 'expensive', 'marketing', 'also', 'intentionally', 'deceptive', '.', 'example', 'picture', 'show', '48', 'oz', 'new', 'improved', 'version', 'physically', 'larger', '64', 'oz', 'version', 'come', 'thats', 'obnoxious', '.', 'youre', 'going', 'provide', 'less', 'charge', 'instead', 'trying', 'dupe', 'people', 'dumb', 'graphics', 'hope', 'rest', 'dont', 'notice', '.', 'larger', 'size', 'nice', 'simply', 'not', 'order', 'refills', 'often', 'likely', 'saved', 'even', 'packaging', 'waste', '.', 'whole', 'move', 'seems', 'pretty', 'counterproductive', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'favorite', 'many', 'years', '.', 'annoying', 'tactics', 'led', 'look', 'brands', 'see', 'else', '.', 'might', 'back', 'might', 'not', '.', 'product', 'pretty', 'good', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'residue', '.', 'doesnt', 'foam', 'much', 'products', 'end', 'using', 'probably', '3x', 'typical', 'body', 'washes', 'heads', '.', 'guess', 'thats', 'added', 'tax', 'cleannatural', 'body', 'washes', 'not', 'certain', 'agents', 'foam', 'maybe', 'good', 'product', 'lame', 'dropped', 'size', '64', 'oz', '48', 'oz', 'kept', 'price', '.']"

this body wash really is as good a others have reported.  i was skeptical about the claims of this being gentle on skin and leaving the skin feeling clean at the same time.  full disclosure i am not a fan of body washes because the only ones ive used in the past have been highly scented and i discarded the washes after discovering this.  i purchased sebamed body wash solely on the basis that it was good for sensitive skin and didnt stink to high heaven.  we have been using this body wash in our travel trailer for the past month or so and it is everything advertised.  neither my husband or i have had any skin irritation after using it it foams nicely on a sponge and leaves the skin feeling nice and clean and it doesnt dry out our skin.  i was concerned that it wouldnt be as effective as the deoderizing soap we had been using that was not the case.  my only tiny complaint about this wash is the slightly funky odor it has when it is dispensed onto the sponge before it is massaged into foaminess.  fortunately the odor dissipates quickly and there is no lingering scent of it after you rinse off.this is a good product worth the extra  to avoid all the skin irritation that can come from soaps and other bathing products.  as an aside a little bit of this wash goes a long way when applied with as soft body sponge.  this pump bottle will last a long time when it only requires a pump or two per shower. impressive body wash  no skin irritation  skin feels nice and clean after using,body wash really good others reported . skeptical claims gentle skin leaving skin feeling clean time . full disclosure not fan body washes ones ive used past highly scented discarded washes discovering . purchased sebamed body wash solely basis good sensitive skin didnt stink high heaven . using body wash travel trailer past month everything advertised . neither husband skin irritation using foams nicely sponge leaves skin feeling nice clean doesnt dry skin . concerned wouldnt effective deoderizing soap using not case . tiny complaint wash slightly funky odor dispensed onto sponge massaged foaminess . fortunately odor dissipates quickly no lingering scent rinse off.this good product worth extra avoid skin irritation come soaps bathing products . aside little bit wash goes long way applied soft body sponge . pump bottle last long time requires pump two per shower . impressive body wash no skin irritation skin feels nice clean using,"['body', 'wash', 'really', 'good', 'others', 'reported', '.', 'skeptical', 'claims', 'gentle', 'skin', 'leaving', 'skin', 'feeling', 'clean', 'time', '.', 'full', 'disclosure', 'not', 'fan', 'body', 'washes', 'ones', 'ive', 'used', 'past', 'highly', 'scented', 'discarded', 'washes', 'discovering', '.', 'purchased', 'sebamed', 'body', 'wash', 'solely', 'basis', 'good', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'didnt', 'stink', 'high', 'heaven', '.', 'using', 'body', 'wash', 'travel', 'trailer', 'past', 'month', 'everything', 'advertised', '.', 'neither', 'husband', 'skin', 'irritation', 'using', 'foams', 'nicely', 'sponge', 'leaves', 'skin', 'feeling', 'nice', 'clean', 'doesnt', 'dry', 'skin', '.', 'concerned', 'wouldnt', 'effective', 'deoderizing', 'soap', 'using', 'not', 'case', '.', 'tiny', 'complaint', 'wash', 'slightly', 'funky', 'odor', 'dispensed', 'onto', 'sponge', 'massaged', 'foaminess', '.', 'fortunately', 'odor', 'dissipates', 'quickly', 'no', 'lingering', 'scent', 'rinse', 'off.this', 'good', 'product', 'worth', 'extra', 'avoid', 'skin', 'irritation', 'come', 'soaps', 'bathing', 'products', '.', 'aside', 'little', 'bit', 'wash', 'goes', 'long', 'way', 'applied', 'soft', 'body', 'sponge', '.', 'pump', 'bottle', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'requires', 'pump', 'two', 'per', 'shower', '.', 'impressive', 'body', 'wash', 'no', 'skin', 'irritation', 'skin', 'feels', 'nice', 'clean', 'using']"

i used this soap for a few days hoping for it to be a cheaper alternative to another tea tree wash that i had been using. however i found that it really did not do a good job to clean and get rid of odors. i tried using it with different loofahs and sponges but it still didnt work. i think part of the problem is that it does not create a lot of suds when combined with water. it smells great but that scent does not last long and unfortunately scent does not keep you clean. maybe this is better used on only certain parts of your body for other conditions but i wouldnt know how well that would work. i would unfortunately recommend skipping this product if you are planning on using it as a full body wash. smells great but doesnt get the job done as a body wash,used soap days hoping cheaper alternative another tea tree wash using . however found really not good job clean get rid odors . tried using different loofahs sponges still didnt work . think part problem not create lot suds combined water . smells great scent not last long unfortunately scent not keep clean . maybe better used certain parts body conditions wouldnt know well would work . would unfortunately recommend skipping product planning using full body wash. smells great doesnt get job done body wash,"['used', 'soap', 'days', 'hoping', 'cheaper', 'alternative', 'another', 'tea', 'tree', 'wash', 'using', '.', 'however', 'found', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'job', 'clean', 'get', 'rid', 'odors', '.', 'tried', 'using', 'different', 'loofahs', 'sponges', 'still', 'didnt', 'work', '.', 'think', 'part', 'problem', 'not', 'create', 'lot', 'suds', 'combined', 'water', '.', 'smells', 'great', 'scent', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'unfortunately', 'scent', 'not', 'keep', 'clean', '.', 'maybe', 'better', 'used', 'certain', 'parts', 'body', 'conditions', 'wouldnt', 'know', 'well', 'would', 'work', '.', 'would', 'unfortunately', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'product', 'planning', 'using', 'full', 'body', 'wash.', 'smells', 'great', 'doesnt', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'body', 'wash']"

i generally dont write reviews on amazon but this face wash has helped so far ive only been using it for. a week. my skin is super sensitive so it takes less than 5 minutes for me to have a bad reaction to a product. its usually harder to tell how it will behave with face products because it takes a week to see the real results. the product does have a slight smell but so far i have noticed that it reduced the amount of oil in my skin but did not completely strip all the oil which is a good thing my only concern is how much it is actually cleaning my face. sometimes when i use witch hazel or a toner to clean any residue i will rub my face it still feels like their is residue i will wait a little longer to see the overall impact to my skin but so far so good ,generally dont write reviews amazon face wash helped far ive using . week . skin super sensitive takes less 5 minutes bad reaction product . usually harder tell behave face products takes week see real results . product slight smell far noticed reduced amount oil skin not completely strip oil good thing concern much actually cleaning face . sometimes use witch hazel toner clean residue rub face still feels like residue wait little longer see overall impact skin far good,"['generally', 'dont', 'write', 'reviews', 'amazon', 'face', 'wash', 'helped', 'far', 'ive', 'using', '.', 'week', '.', 'skin', 'super', 'sensitive', 'takes', 'less', '5', 'minutes', 'bad', 'reaction', 'product', '.', 'usually', 'harder', 'tell', 'behave', 'face', 'products', 'takes', 'week', 'see', 'real', 'results', '.', 'product', 'slight', 'smell', 'far', 'noticed', 'reduced', 'amount', 'oil', 'skin', 'not', 'completely', 'strip', 'oil', 'good', 'thing', 'concern', 'much', 'actually', 'cleaning', 'face', '.', 'sometimes', 'use', 'witch', 'hazel', 'toner', 'clean', 'residue', 'rub', 'face', 'still', 'feels', 'like', 'residue', 'wait', 'little', 'longer', 'see', 'overall', 'impact', 'skin', 'far', 'good']"

i have been looking for a body wash that didnt leave my skin tight or dry and this is it. i tried dove dr bronners black soap and all these organics but they all made my skin dry and tight. i guess it really does matter about are skin barrier because this product leaves me smooth no tightness at all or dry. but not good for my face. my face gets super itchy and sensitive. but works amazing for my body. healing up all my dry skin and healing folliculitis on my back.there is a little itching it leaves on my elbows but thats it. i use a loofah . suds up super good. at first i only used my hands but didnt  bubble up that much. so i used to loofa to feel better about it. i guess because we are so used too having that feeling or seeing bubbles. it does smell weird but who cares it leaves my skin smooth. smells like gel or lemon. idk but it works. should last a while i f you use a loofah.i give it a 4 because it irritates face and little itchy on elbows.update 21418so at first i use to apply the liquid straight onto my face but now i shake the bottle first and apply it to loofah than i take some of the suds with my hand and apply to face and i get 0 irritation. im giving it 5 stars now. and no more itching on elbows . hopefully amazon gets the fragrance free kind. finally bodywash thats heals,looking body wash didnt leave skin tight dry . tried dove dr bronners black soap organics made skin dry tight . guess really matter skin barrier product leaves smooth no tightness dry . not good face . face gets super itchy sensitive . works amazing body . healing dry skin healing folliculitis back.there little itching leaves elbows thats . use loofah . suds super good . first used hands didnt bubble much . used loofa feel better . guess used feeling seeing bubbles . smell weird cares leaves skin smooth . smells like gel lemon . idk works . last f use loofah.i give 4 irritates face little itchy elbows.update 21418so first use apply liquid straight onto face shake bottle first apply loofah take suds hand apply face get 0 irritation . im giving 5 stars . no itching elbows . hopefully amazon gets fragrance free kind . finally bodywash thats heals,"['looking', 'body', 'wash', 'didnt', 'leave', 'skin', 'tight', 'dry', '.', 'tried', 'dove', 'dr', 'bronners', 'black', 'soap', 'organics', 'made', 'skin', 'dry', 'tight', '.', 'guess', 'really', 'matter', 'skin', 'barrier', 'product', 'leaves', 'smooth', 'no', 'tightness', 'dry', '.', 'not', 'good', 'face', '.', 'face', 'gets', 'super', 'itchy', 'sensitive', '.', 'works', 'amazing', 'body', '.', 'healing', 'dry', 'skin', 'healing', 'folliculitis', 'back.there', 'little', 'itching', 'leaves', 'elbows', 'thats', '.', 'use', 'loofah', '.', 'suds', 'super', 'good', '.', 'first', 'used', 'hands', 'didnt', 'bubble', 'much', '.', 'used', 'loofa', 'feel', 'better', '.', 'guess', 'used', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'bubbles', '.', 'smell', 'weird', 'cares', 'leaves', 'skin', 'smooth', '.', 'smells', 'like', 'gel', 'lemon', '.', 'idk', 'works', '.', 'last', 'f', 'use', 'loofah.i', 'give', '4', 'irritates', 'face', 'little', 'itchy', 'elbows.update', '21418so', 'first', 'use', 'apply', 'liquid', 'straight', 'onto', 'face', 'shake', 'bottle', 'first', 'apply', 'loofah', 'take', 'suds', 'hand', 'apply', 'face', 'get', '0', 'irritation', '.', 'im', 'giving', '5', 'stars', '.', 'no', 'itching', 'elbows', '.', 'hopefully', 'amazon', 'gets', 'fragrance', 'free', 'kind', '.', 'finally', 'bodywash', 'thats', 'heals']"

i have been using sebamed since i was an exchange student in germany in 1987.  i have been lucky  for the last 24 years i have either been able to pick up a bottle or two or four in germany myself or friends have sent it to me.  you can think of sebamed as a soap because it does all the things soap does but it isnt a soap because there is no lye in it and it leaves no residue on your skin and if you have never felt your skin after it has been washed with a balanced ph cleaner you may not be able to appreciate how that feels but i wouldnt give it up for the world.  since i started using sebamed i have found nothing that compares to it  at any price.  it is especially good for cleaning cuts and wounds because its so gentle and doesnt have a lot of harsh chemicals. i also love the smell of it and you can also use it for washing your hair although they make a really nice shampoo.  my only complaint is that i cant buy it at the drug store.  you could buy it at costco for a while but i think because the bottle looks kind of medicinal and its not cheap people didnt try it out much.  they should have started with smaller bottles or had samples to give away in store. best soap there is.,using sebamed since exchange student germany 1987. lucky last 24 years either able pick bottle two four germany friends sent . think sebamed soap things soap isnt soap no lye leaves no residue skin never felt skin washed balanced ph cleaner may not able appreciate feels wouldnt give world . since started using sebamed found nothing compares price . especially good cleaning cuts wounds gentle doesnt lot harsh chemicals . also love smell also use washing hair although make really nice shampoo . complaint cant buy drug store . could buy costco think bottle looks kind medicinal not cheap people didnt try much . started smaller bottles samples give away store . best soap .,"['using', 'sebamed', 'since', 'exchange', 'student', 'germany', '1987.', 'lucky', 'last', '24', 'years', 'either', 'able', 'pick', 'bottle', 'two', 'four', 'germany', 'friends', 'sent', '.', 'think', 'sebamed', 'soap', 'things', 'soap', 'isnt', 'soap', 'no', 'lye', 'leaves', 'no', 'residue', 'skin', 'never', 'felt', 'skin', 'washed', 'balanced', 'ph', 'cleaner', 'may', 'not', 'able', 'appreciate', 'feels', 'wouldnt', 'give', 'world', '.', 'since', 'started', 'using', 'sebamed', 'found', 'nothing', 'compares', 'price', '.', 'especially', 'good', 'cleaning', 'cuts', 'wounds', 'gentle', 'doesnt', 'lot', 'harsh', 'chemicals', '.', 'also', 'love', 'smell', 'also', 'use', 'washing', 'hair', 'although', 'make', 'really', 'nice', 'shampoo', '.', 'complaint', 'cant', 'buy', 'drug', 'store', '.', 'could', 'buy', 'costco', 'think', 'bottle', 'looks', 'kind', 'medicinal', 'not', 'cheap', 'people', 'didnt', 'try', 'much', '.', 'started', 'smaller', 'bottles', 'samples', 'give', 'away', 'store', '.', 'best', 'soap', '.']"

i have sensitive skin. well actually seborrheic dermatitis which means my skin is not only sensitive but gets pretty dry and flaky. i also try to use products that dont test on animals. and for bathroom products thats not very easy to find. well maybe it is at whole foods but not at a regular grocery store. so i was surprised when i was at costco and came across this body wash and that it had the cruelty free icon on it.initially i was put off by the label and the name. it just seemed very clinical and medicinal. but i figured id give it a shot and im glad i did. though ive been committed to trying cruelty free products ive unfortunately found that some of those products aggravated my skin and yes i realize its possibly because they dont have the same testing standards as the products that do test on animals. so maybe a more clinical kind of product is what i needed.some have commented on the smell. i think the closest comparison i could come up with when trying to describe the smell is that its kind of like baby powder but not quite as good. but certainly not unpleasant at least to me. but my focus is on the results. when i used this my skin felt great. not itchy not flaky. just moist and clean.having gone through all the products ive tried with the conditions that i have with my skin and to have such positive results i cant speak highly enough of this product. maybe if i didnt have issues with my skin id be somewhat indifferent about it. but it has made such a difference for me that i am solidly in the sebamed camp. great body wash for those with dry itchy sensitive skin,sensitive skin . well actually seborrheic dermatitis means skin not sensitive gets pretty dry flaky . also try use products dont test animals . bathroom products thats not easy find . well maybe whole foods not regular grocery store . surprised costco came across body wash cruelty free icon it.initially put label name . seemed clinical medicinal . figured id give shot im glad . though ive committed trying cruelty free products ive unfortunately found products aggravated skin yes realize possibly dont testing standards products test animals . maybe clinical kind product needed.some commented smell . think closest comparison could come trying describe smell kind like baby powder not quite good . certainly not unpleasant least . focus results . used skin felt great . not itchy not flaky . moist clean.having gone products ive tried conditions skin positive results cant speak highly enough product . maybe didnt issues skin id somewhat indifferent . made difference solidly sebamed camp . great body wash dry itchy sensitive skin,"['sensitive', 'skin', '.', 'well', 'actually', 'seborrheic', 'dermatitis', 'means', 'skin', 'not', 'sensitive', 'gets', 'pretty', 'dry', 'flaky', '.', 'also', 'try', 'use', 'products', 'dont', 'test', 'animals', '.', 'bathroom', 'products', 'thats', 'not', 'easy', 'find', '.', 'well', 'maybe', 'whole', 'foods', 'not', 'regular', 'grocery', 'store', '.', 'surprised', 'costco', 'came', 'across', 'body', 'wash', 'cruelty', 'free', 'icon', 'it.initially', 'put', 'label', 'name', '.', 'seemed', 'clinical', 'medicinal', '.', 'figured', 'id', 'give', 'shot', 'im', 'glad', '.', 'though', 'ive', 'committed', 'trying', 'cruelty', 'free', 'products', 'ive', 'unfortunately', 'found', 'products', 'aggravated', 'skin', 'yes', 'realize', 'possibly', 'dont', 'testing', 'standards', 'products', 'test', 'animals', '.', 'maybe', 'clinical', 'kind', 'product', 'needed.some', 'commented', 'smell', '.', 'think', 'closest', 'comparison', 'could', 'come', 'trying', 'describe', 'smell', 'kind', 'like', 'baby', 'powder', 'not', 'quite', 'good', '.', 'certainly', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'least', '.', 'focus', 'results', '.', 'used', 'skin', 'felt', 'great', '.', 'not', 'itchy', 'not', 'flaky', '.', 'moist', 'clean.having', 'gone', 'products', 'ive', 'tried', 'conditions', 'skin', 'positive', 'results', 'cant', 'speak', 'highly', 'enough', 'product', '.', 'maybe', 'didnt', 'issues', 'skin', 'id', 'somewhat', 'indifferent', '.', 'made', 'difference', 'solidly', 'sebamed', 'camp', '.', 'great', 'body', 'wash', 'dry', 'itchy', 'sensitive', 'skin']"

this summer i experienced an allergic reaction to what had to have been my laundry detergent. i had a severe rash and the itching was so intense that i would wake up at night feeling like my skin was crawling.ive experienced eczemaatopic dermatitis in the past and my doctors recommendation was to use cerave or cetaphil cleansers. however this was so extreme. i was convinced i needed expensive antiitch soaps and medications. i tried calamine soap ditch the itch soap benadryl  hydrocortisone creams a topical analgesic and calamine spray before going to the doctor.once again my doctors recommendation was to use either cerave or cetaphil cleansers plus a prescriptionstrength topical steroid while we worked out what was causing the problem.ultimately removing the irritant the laundry detergent and using a steroid ointment were key in healing. however cetaphil saved the day once again. with my irritated inflamed skin i needed to use a very gentle cleanser.i chose this one as it is fragrancefree and i thought a body wash would be soothing. it was. fragrancefree doesnt necessarily mean scentfree and this does have a slight aroma. however it is subtle and pleasant with a very slight clean scent. a great product for my sensitive skin a great product for my sensitive skin,summer experienced allergic reaction laundry detergent . severe rash itching intense would wake night feeling like skin crawling.ive experienced eczemaatopic dermatitis past doctors recommendation use cerave cetaphil cleansers . however extreme . convinced needed expensive antiitch soaps medications . tried calamine soap ditch itch soap benadryl hydrocortisone creams topical analgesic calamine spray going doctor.once doctors recommendation use either cerave cetaphil cleansers plus prescriptionstrength topical steroid worked causing problem.ultimately removing irritant laundry detergent using steroid ointment key healing . however cetaphil saved day . irritated inflamed skin needed use gentle cleanser.i chose one fragrancefree thought body wash would soothing . . fragrancefree doesnt necessarily mean scentfree slight aroma . however subtle pleasant slight clean scent . great product sensitive skin great product sensitive skin,"['summer', 'experienced', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'laundry', 'detergent', '.', 'severe', 'rash', 'itching', 'intense', 'would', 'wake', 'night', 'feeling', 'like', 'skin', 'crawling.ive', 'experienced', 'eczemaatopic', 'dermatitis', 'past', 'doctors', 'recommendation', 'use', 'cerave', 'cetaphil', 'cleansers', '.', 'however', 'extreme', '.', 'convinced', 'needed', 'expensive', 'antiitch', 'soaps', 'medications', '.', 'tried', 'calamine', 'soap', 'ditch', 'itch', 'soap', 'benadryl', 'hydrocortisone', 'creams', 'topical', 'analgesic', 'calamine', 'spray', 'going', 'doctor.once', 'doctors', 'recommendation', 'use', 'either', 'cerave', 'cetaphil', 'cleansers', 'plus', 'prescriptionstrength', 'topical', 'steroid', 'worked', 'causing', 'problem.ultimately', 'removing', 'irritant', 'laundry', 'detergent', 'using', 'steroid', 'ointment', 'key', 'healing', '.', 'however', 'cetaphil', 'saved', 'day', '.', 'irritated', 'inflamed', 'skin', 'needed', 'use', 'gentle', 'cleanser.i', 'chose', 'one', 'fragrancefree', 'thought', 'body', 'wash', 'would', 'soothing', '.', '.', 'fragrancefree', 'doesnt', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'scentfree', 'slight', 'aroma', '.', 'however', 'subtle', 'pleasant', 'slight', 'clean', 'scent', '.', 'great', 'product', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'great', 'product', 'sensitive', 'skin']"

i started the switch from regular bar soaps to body washes about a year ago. not happy with any and stumbled onto this. picked the bergamotsandlewood scent and found it pleasantly earthy scent that may be described as leaning a little towards masculine but not decidedly so. the soap cleans well i didnt notice any moisturizing properties but wasnt shopping for that feature rinses completely without leaving any film. it leaves a nice subtle remnant of the scent. i will order again. the only problem i experienced was the pump mechanism on the second bottle you get two with the two bottles didnt function and i had already thrown out the first one which made getting product out of the bottle a little cumbersome in the shower. i think this was probably a oneoff given the quality of packaging and product but will ensure both pumps work upon arrival next time. great productcheck pump mechanism upon arrival,started switch regular bar soaps body washes year ago . not happy stumbled onto . picked bergamotsandlewood scent found pleasantly earthy scent may described leaning little towards masculine not decidedly . soap cleans well didnt notice moisturizing properties wasnt shopping feature rinses completely without leaving film . leaves nice subtle remnant scent . order . problem experienced pump mechanism second bottle get two two bottles didnt function already thrown first one made getting product bottle little cumbersome shower . think probably oneoff given quality packaging product ensure pumps work upon arrival next time . great productcheck pump mechanism upon arrival,"['started', 'switch', 'regular', 'bar', 'soaps', 'body', 'washes', 'year', 'ago', '.', 'not', 'happy', 'stumbled', 'onto', '.', 'picked', 'bergamotsandlewood', 'scent', 'found', 'pleasantly', 'earthy', 'scent', 'may', 'described', 'leaning', 'little', 'towards', 'masculine', 'not', 'decidedly', '.', 'soap', 'cleans', 'well', 'didnt', 'notice', 'moisturizing', 'properties', 'wasnt', 'shopping', 'feature', 'rinses', 'completely', 'without', 'leaving', 'film', '.', 'leaves', 'nice', 'subtle', 'remnant', 'scent', '.', 'order', '.', 'problem', 'experienced', 'pump', 'mechanism', 'second', 'bottle', 'get', 'two', 'two', 'bottles', 'didnt', 'function', 'already', 'thrown', 'first', 'one', 'made', 'getting', 'product', 'bottle', 'little', 'cumbersome', 'shower', '.', 'think', 'probably', 'oneoff', 'given', 'quality', 'packaging', 'product', 'ensure', 'pumps', 'work', 'upon', 'arrival', 'next', 'time', '.', 'great', 'productcheck', 'pump', 'mechanism', 'upon', 'arrival']"

im not entirely certain how others are able to smell a pleasant grapefruit scent as many had discussed in their reviews. there was no such pleasant smell. what i didnt like was the dry and irritated skin ive had immediately after showering with this gel these last few days. we all have different body chemistries so i cant fault the manufacturer which evidently strives to produce an eco friendly product which i applaud.  this product just isnt for me. i gave it two stars because i did feel mislead by that grapefruitcitrus scent.lastly this is yet another amazon reseller that will send you unsolicited emails after your purchase requesting positive reviews am amazon.  a practice amazon needs to begin regulating.  therefore please take some of the other reviews with a grain of salt.updated on november 4 2014i have changed my review from two to five stars.  my hippie husband hates waste and added a few drops of a natural antifungal tea tree oil to this body wash.  we live in an unusual environment above 8000 feet where fungus can be a problem.  he encouraged me to give this modified body wash a few more tries.  my skin still remains irritated after the shower but i have noticed an improvement in general body odor hairy celtic jew here and ive noticed an improvement in general body acne.  thus ive ordered a second bottle and have revised my initial review. btw.  i still cant smell citrus in the second bottle but this time around im not purchasing the body wash for a pleasant scent. what i didnt like was the dry and irritated skin ive had immediately .,im not entirely certain others able smell pleasant grapefruit scent many discussed reviews . no pleasant smell . didnt like dry irritated skin ive immediately showering gel last days . different body chemistries cant fault manufacturer evidently strives produce eco friendly product applaud . product isnt . gave two stars feel mislead grapefruitcitrus scent.lastly yet another amazon reseller send unsolicited emails purchase requesting positive reviews amazon . practice amazon needs begin regulating . therefore please take reviews grain salt.updated november 4 2014i changed review two five stars . hippie husband hates waste added drops natural antifungal tea tree oil body wash. live unusual environment 8000 feet fungus problem . encouraged give modified body wash tries . skin still remains irritated shower noticed improvement general body odor hairy celtic jew ive noticed improvement general body acne . thus ive ordered second bottle revised initial review . btw . still cant smell citrus second bottle time around im not purchasing body wash pleasant scent . didnt like dry irritated skin ive immediately .,"['im', 'not', 'entirely', 'certain', 'others', 'able', 'smell', 'pleasant', 'grapefruit', 'scent', 'many', 'discussed', 'reviews', '.', 'no', 'pleasant', 'smell', '.', 'didnt', 'like', 'dry', 'irritated', 'skin', 'ive', 'immediately', 'showering', 'gel', 'last', 'days', '.', 'different', 'body', 'chemistries', 'cant', 'fault', 'manufacturer', 'evidently', 'strives', 'produce', 'eco', 'friendly', 'product', 'applaud', '.', 'product', 'isnt', '.', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'feel', 'mislead', 'grapefruitcitrus', 'scent.lastly', 'yet', 'another', 'amazon', 'reseller', 'send', 'unsolicited', 'emails', 'purchase', 'requesting', 'positive', 'reviews', 'amazon', '.', 'practice', 'amazon', 'needs', 'begin', 'regulating', '.', 'therefore', 'please', 'take', 'reviews', 'grain', 'salt.updated', 'november', '4', '2014i', 'changed', 'review', 'two', 'five', 'stars', '.', 'hippie', 'husband', 'hates', 'waste', 'added', 'drops', 'natural', 'antifungal', 'tea', 'tree', 'oil', 'body', 'wash.', 'live', 'unusual', 'environment', '8000', 'feet', 'fungus', 'problem', '.', 'encouraged', 'give', 'modified', 'body', 'wash', 'tries', '.', 'skin', 'still', 'remains', 'irritated', 'shower', 'noticed', 'improvement', 'general', 'body', 'odor', 'hairy', 'celtic', 'jew', 'ive', 'noticed', 'improvement', 'general', 'body', 'acne', '.', 'thus', 'ive', 'ordered', 'second', 'bottle', 'revised', 'initial', 'review', '.', 'btw', '.', 'still', 'cant', 'smell', 'citrus', 'second', 'bottle', 'time', 'around', 'im', 'not', 'purchasing', 'body', 'wash', 'pleasant', 'scent', '.', 'didnt', 'like', 'dry', 'irritated', 'skin', 'ive', 'immediately', '.']"

if you are sensitive to strong smells like me then i cant recommend this.i love almost all puracy products ive tried the lavendergrapefruit baby lotion the lavendervanilla foaming hand soap and the toilet spray in particular but those actually smell like what they claim to smell like  like lavender and vanilla for example.  so i was shocked when i smelled this body wash.  it does not smell like citrus to me.  i am extremely sensitive to smells and there is natural fragrance in the ingredient list which does not work for me at all.however their customer service is excellent.  i contacted them and they gave me a full refund and instructed me to give the rest away or donate it.  i didnt have to ship it back.  obviously they stand by their products.  also they explained that the natural fragrance is in fact natural  its derived from essential oils floral extracts and plantbased aromaproducing ingredients nothing synthetic or chemical.  they dont give away the exact ingredients since its a proprietary blend which i understand.  they also said there are some new scents in this bodywash coming soon so maybe those will be better for those of us with overly sensitive noses.  i thought about trying their baby wash but ultimately decided against it.  i will continue buying the foaming hand soap the baby lotion and the toilet spray indefinitely unless they change something.  their shampoo and conditioner smells pretty strong too but its not nearly as bad doesnt have natural fragrance in it and makes my hair look and feel amazing.  i just bought big refills of both of those products and will probably continue to do so.  ill review that stuff soon too. dont like the smell  customer service is excellent,sensitive strong smells like cant recommend this.i love almost puracy products ive tried lavendergrapefruit baby lotion lavendervanilla foaming hand soap toilet spray particular actually smell like claim smell like like lavender vanilla example . shocked smelled body wash. not smell like citrus . extremely sensitive smells natural fragrance ingredient list not work all.however customer service excellent . contacted gave full refund instructed give rest away donate . didnt ship back . obviously stand products . also explained natural fragrance fact natural derived essential oils floral extracts plantbased aromaproducing ingredients nothing synthetic chemical . dont give away exact ingredients since proprietary blend understand . also said new scents bodywash coming soon maybe better us overly sensitive noses . thought trying baby wash ultimately decided . continue buying foaming hand soap baby lotion toilet spray indefinitely unless change something . shampoo conditioner smells pretty strong not nearly bad doesnt natural fragrance makes hair look feel amazing . bought big refills products probably continue . ill review stuff soon . dont like smell customer service excellent,"['sensitive', 'strong', 'smells', 'like', 'cant', 'recommend', 'this.i', 'love', 'almost', 'puracy', 'products', 'ive', 'tried', 'lavendergrapefruit', 'baby', 'lotion', 'lavendervanilla', 'foaming', 'hand', 'soap', 'toilet', 'spray', 'particular', 'actually', 'smell', 'like', 'claim', 'smell', 'like', 'like', 'lavender', 'vanilla', 'example', '.', 'shocked', 'smelled', 'body', 'wash.', 'not', 'smell', 'like', 'citrus', '.', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'smells', 'natural', 'fragrance', 'ingredient', 'list', 'not', 'work', 'all.however', 'customer', 'service', 'excellent', '.', 'contacted', 'gave', 'full', 'refund', 'instructed', 'give', 'rest', 'away', 'donate', '.', 'didnt', 'ship', 'back', '.', 'obviously', 'stand', 'products', '.', 'also', 'explained', 'natural', 'fragrance', 'fact', 'natural', 'derived', 'essential', 'oils', 'floral', 'extracts', 'plantbased', 'aromaproducing', 'ingredients', 'nothing', 'synthetic', 'chemical', '.', 'dont', 'give', 'away', 'exact', 'ingredients', 'since', 'proprietary', 'blend', 'understand', '.', 'also', 'said', 'new', 'scents', 'bodywash', 'coming', 'soon', 'maybe', 'better', 'us', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'noses', '.', 'thought', 'trying', 'baby', 'wash', 'ultimately', 'decided', '.', 'continue', 'buying', 'foaming', 'hand', 'soap', 'baby', 'lotion', 'toilet', 'spray', 'indefinitely', 'unless', 'change', 'something', '.', 'shampoo', 'conditioner', 'smells', 'pretty', 'strong', 'not', 'nearly', 'bad', 'doesnt', 'natural', 'fragrance', 'makes', 'hair', 'look', 'feel', 'amazing', '.', 'bought', 'big', 'refills', 'products', 'probably', 'continue', '.', 'ill', 'review', 'stuff', 'soon', '.', 'dont', 'like', 'smell', 'customer', 'service', 'excellent']"

i rated the product with 5 stars because its the exact same product in the bottle and label that i have purchased numerous times through amazon. i have issues with dryness and sores stemming from peripheral neuropathy a diabetic condition and my pcp found and recommended this specific product based on a number of desirable safe attributes. the description on the amazon purchase site and the bottles listed was supposed to be face and body wash 12ounce. what i received was 2 12 ounce bottles of body wash. why this is important is that puracy has eliminated the 16ounce bottles that i normally buy and are charging close to or exactly the same price as for the 12ounce.  i feel that this is deceptive. they also eliminated to 64ounce refill pouches and now only vend the 48ounce size. ill use the product received and determine if there are any changes to the composition prior to making any additional purchases. ,rated product 5 stars exact product bottle label purchased numerous times amazon . issues dryness sores stemming peripheral neuropathy diabetic condition pcp found recommended specific product based number desirable safe attributes . description amazon purchase site bottles listed supposed face body wash 12ounce . received 2 12 ounce bottles body wash. important puracy eliminated 16ounce bottles normally buy charging close exactly price 12ounce . feel deceptive . also eliminated 64ounce refill pouches vend 48ounce size . ill use product received determine changes composition prior making additional purchases .,"['rated', 'product', '5', 'stars', 'exact', 'product', 'bottle', 'label', 'purchased', 'numerous', 'times', 'amazon', '.', 'issues', 'dryness', 'sores', 'stemming', 'peripheral', 'neuropathy', 'diabetic', 'condition', 'pcp', 'found', 'recommended', 'specific', 'product', 'based', 'number', 'desirable', 'safe', 'attributes', '.', 'description', 'amazon', 'purchase', 'site', 'bottles', 'listed', 'supposed', 'face', 'body', 'wash', '12ounce', '.', 'received', '2', '12', 'ounce', 'bottles', 'body', 'wash.', 'important', 'puracy', 'eliminated', '16ounce', 'bottles', 'normally', 'buy', 'charging', 'close', 'exactly', 'price', '12ounce', '.', 'feel', 'deceptive', '.', 'also', 'eliminated', '64ounce', 'refill', 'pouches', 'vend', '48ounce', 'size', '.', 'ill', 'use', 'product', 'received', 'determine', 'changes', 'composition', 'prior', 'making', 'additional', 'purchases', '.']"

i cannot recommend this body wash highly enough. in the last few years my skin has become increasingly sensitive. one of the myriad less lovable effects of menopause for me has been thinning and highly sensitive skin which has resulted in the sudden and rather mysterious appearance of little scratches and cuts on my body and eczema like patches of skin that appear and disappear randomly and for reasons that i couldnt fathom. the dermatologist confirmed that this was a common symptom post menopause. i was trying various natural sulfate free products which were pleasant enough and it didnt seem to make much difference. i came across this company on amazon and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. i was skeptical because of how many other products had proven underwhelming. i was amazed and thrilled when i first use this product. it has a very pleasant and light lemony smell lathers up nicely but most importantly leaves my skin soft and supple with no itchy patches or irritation. months later i am still using this product with the same happy effect. i went to see my esthetician last week and she commented on how soft my skin was. i also use the body lotion which i love. it goes on easily sinks in really fast and doesnt leave any greasy residue at all. i feel as though my skin can breathe. thank you puracy for creating these wonderful products. i am now going to buy the household products and i am very excited to see how they work. who knew that i would ever be excited about using a household product absolutely brilliant product. happy skin at last,not recommend body wash highly enough . last years skin become increasingly sensitive . one myriad less lovable effects menopause thinning highly sensitive skin resulted sudden rather mysterious appearance little scratches cuts body eczema like patches skin appear disappear randomly reasons couldnt fathom . dermatologist confirmed common symptom post menopause . trying various natural sulfate free products pleasant enough didnt seem make much difference . came across company amazon decided give try based reviews . skeptical many products proven underwhelming . amazed thrilled first use product . pleasant light lemony smell lathers nicely importantly leaves skin soft supple no itchy patches irritation . months later still using product happy effect . went see esthetician last week commented soft skin . also use body lotion love . goes easily sinks really fast doesnt leave greasy residue . feel though skin breathe . thank puracy creating wonderful products . going buy household products excited see work . knew would ever excited using household product absolutely brilliant product . happy skin last,"['not', 'recommend', 'body', 'wash', 'highly', 'enough', '.', 'last', 'years', 'skin', 'become', 'increasingly', 'sensitive', '.', 'one', 'myriad', 'less', 'lovable', 'effects', 'menopause', 'thinning', 'highly', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'resulted', 'sudden', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'appearance', 'little', 'scratches', 'cuts', 'body', 'eczema', 'like', 'patches', 'skin', 'appear', 'disappear', 'randomly', 'reasons', 'couldnt', 'fathom', '.', 'dermatologist', 'confirmed', 'common', 'symptom', 'post', 'menopause', '.', 'trying', 'various', 'natural', 'sulfate', 'free', 'products', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'didnt', 'seem', 'make', 'much', 'difference', '.', 'came', 'across', 'company', 'amazon', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'based', 'reviews', '.', 'skeptical', 'many', 'products', 'proven', 'underwhelming', '.', 'amazed', 'thrilled', 'first', 'use', 'product', '.', 'pleasant', 'light', 'lemony', 'smell', 'lathers', 'nicely', 'importantly', 'leaves', 'skin', 'soft', 'supple', 'no', 'itchy', 'patches', 'irritation', '.', 'months', 'later', 'still', 'using', 'product', 'happy', 'effect', '.', 'went', 'see', 'esthetician', 'last', 'week', 'commented', 'soft', 'skin', '.', 'also', 'use', 'body', 'lotion', 'love', '.', 'goes', 'easily', 'sinks', 'really', 'fast', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'greasy', 'residue', '.', 'feel', 'though', 'skin', 'breathe', '.', 'thank', 'puracy', 'creating', 'wonderful', 'products', '.', 'going', 'buy', 'household', 'products', 'excited', 'see', 'work', '.', 'knew', 'would', 'ever', 'excited', 'using', 'household', 'product', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'product', '.', 'happy', 'skin', 'last']"

this body soap is spectacular  i decided to try it based on the reviews.  i have used neutrogena for years and have been very happy with it.  but i have found over the past year or so that i seemed to have gotten more body odor ewww and that soap wasnt eliminating it after my shower.  so i went searching for something new.  i also have become increasingly concerned about chemicals on my body.  being a loyal neutrogena user for years i had not looked at the ingredients in a very long time.  wow did i realize how ignorant i had become.  so i decided to give puracy a try.my first shower sold me.  the lather was great the lack of scent was even better the skin feel was really great.  and most importantly the odor elimination was instant and long lasting.  i dont use any commercial odor eliminating products on my body.  i havent for decades.  i think they are toxic.  but i do have to live in the modern world.  so it takes an effort to find an organic alternative.  often they are not as effective as i would like.  using puracy seems to have helped my alternative products work much better and longer.wow  reading this now.makes it sound like i stink to high heaven  i hope thats not really the case  its a great product and i am just now buying their household products for a try.fwiw i fully endorse this body soap. very impressed with this product.,body soap spectacular decided try based reviews . used neutrogena years happy . found past year seemed gotten body odor ewww soap wasnt eliminating shower . went searching something new . also become increasingly concerned chemicals body . loyal neutrogena user years not looked ingredients long time . wow realize ignorant become . decided give puracy try.my first shower sold . lather great lack scent even better skin feel really great . importantly odor elimination instant long lasting . dont use commercial odor eliminating products body . havent decades . think toxic . live modern world . takes effort find organic alternative . often not effective would like . using puracy seems helped alternative products work much better longer.wow reading now.makes sound like stink high heaven hope thats not really case great product buying household products try.fwiw fully endorse body soap . impressed product .,"['body', 'soap', 'spectacular', 'decided', 'try', 'based', 'reviews', '.', 'used', 'neutrogena', 'years', 'happy', '.', 'found', 'past', 'year', 'seemed', 'gotten', 'body', 'odor', 'ewww', 'soap', 'wasnt', 'eliminating', 'shower', '.', 'went', 'searching', 'something', 'new', '.', 'also', 'become', 'increasingly', 'concerned', 'chemicals', 'body', '.', 'loyal', 'neutrogena', 'user', 'years', 'not', 'looked', 'ingredients', 'long', 'time', '.', 'wow', 'realize', 'ignorant', 'become', '.', 'decided', 'give', 'puracy', 'try.my', 'first', 'shower', 'sold', '.', 'lather', 'great', 'lack', 'scent', 'even', 'better', 'skin', 'feel', 'really', 'great', '.', 'importantly', 'odor', 'elimination', 'instant', 'long', 'lasting', '.', 'dont', 'use', 'commercial', 'odor', 'eliminating', 'products', 'body', '.', 'havent', 'decades', '.', 'think', 'toxic', '.', 'live', 'modern', 'world', '.', 'takes', 'effort', 'find', 'organic', 'alternative', '.', 'often', 'not', 'effective', 'would', 'like', '.', 'using', 'puracy', 'seems', 'helped', 'alternative', 'products', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'longer.wow', 'reading', 'now.makes', 'sound', 'like', 'stink', 'high', 'heaven', 'hope', 'thats', 'not', 'really', 'case', 'great', 'product', 'buying', 'household', 'products', 'try.fwiw', 'fully', 'endorse', 'body', 'soap', '.', 'impressed', 'product', '.']"

i purchased doves deep moisture body wash hoping it would help with my dry skin. the product comes in a convenient pump bottle making it easy to use in the shower. it certainly leaves my skin feeling softer and appears to lock in moisture for a while after use.however while it moisturizes effectively im not completely satisfied. the body wash is thicker than i expected which makes it a bit hard to rinse off completely. sometimes it leaves a slight residue that doesnt feel entirely clean.also while the moisturizing effect is noticeable it doesnt last as long as i hoped. i find myself needing to apply lotion soon after drying off which isnt ideal. moisturizes well but not perfect,purchased doves deep moisture body wash hoping would help dry skin . product comes convenient pump bottle making easy use shower . certainly leaves skin feeling softer appears lock moisture use.however moisturizes effectively im not completely satisfied . body wash thicker expected makes bit hard rinse completely . sometimes leaves slight residue doesnt feel entirely clean.also moisturizing effect noticeable doesnt last long hoped . find needing apply lotion soon drying isnt ideal . moisturizes well not perfect,"['purchased', 'doves', 'deep', 'moisture', 'body', 'wash', 'hoping', 'would', 'help', 'dry', 'skin', '.', 'product', 'comes', 'convenient', 'pump', 'bottle', 'making', 'easy', 'use', 'shower', '.', 'certainly', 'leaves', 'skin', 'feeling', 'softer', 'appears', 'lock', 'moisture', 'use.however', 'moisturizes', 'effectively', 'im', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfied', '.', 'body', 'wash', 'thicker', 'expected', 'makes', 'bit', 'hard', 'rinse', 'completely', '.', 'sometimes', 'leaves', 'slight', 'residue', 'doesnt', 'feel', 'entirely', 'clean.also', 'moisturizing', 'effect', 'noticeable', 'doesnt', 'last', 'long', 'hoped', '.', 'find', 'needing', 'apply', 'lotion', 'soon', 'drying', 'isnt', 'ideal', '.', 'moisturizes', 'well', 'not', 'perfect']"

first to address the same issues about which others have commented the smell of the soap i received is quite pleasant. minty fresh. i see what others mean about the pump. it doesnt give you much per squirt and moves pretty slow preventing you from pumping very fast. however there may be different bottles and some of you might get different scents or different pumps. mine also lathers up well enough.the main issue i have is the way the soap works  or rather doesnt work for me. i bought it to relieve and hopefully help cure a particular itch in a delicate area. ok ill just say it  jock itch.  no matter how much i use and how long i scrub i use one of those shower gloves with a bit of a rough texture for exfoliating the itch quickly returns. usually later the same day. it helps when i use a jock itch spray after my shower but there are times when i dont want the spray to interfere with any um intimate encounters. so i will be looking for something different. shame ive got so darn much of this stuff. two large bottles great value if only it worked as id like it to. doesnt relieve the itch as well as id like,first address issues others commented smell soap received quite pleasant . minty fresh . see others mean pump . doesnt give much per squirt moves pretty slow preventing pumping fast . however may different bottles might get different scents different pumps . mine also lathers well enough.the main issue way soap works rather doesnt work . bought relieve hopefully help cure particular itch delicate area . ok ill say jock itch . no matter much use long scrub use one shower gloves bit rough texture exfoliating itch quickly returns . usually later day . helps use jock itch spray shower times dont want spray interfere um intimate encounters . looking something different . shame ive got darn much stuff . two large bottles great value worked id like . doesnt relieve itch well id like,"['first', 'address', 'issues', 'others', 'commented', 'smell', 'soap', 'received', 'quite', 'pleasant', '.', 'minty', 'fresh', '.', 'see', 'others', 'mean', 'pump', '.', 'doesnt', 'give', 'much', 'per', 'squirt', 'moves', 'pretty', 'slow', 'preventing', 'pumping', 'fast', '.', 'however', 'may', 'different', 'bottles', 'might', 'get', 'different', 'scents', 'different', 'pumps', '.', 'mine', 'also', 'lathers', 'well', 'enough.the', 'main', 'issue', 'way', 'soap', 'works', 'rather', 'doesnt', 'work', '.', 'bought', 'relieve', 'hopefully', 'help', 'cure', 'particular', 'itch', 'delicate', 'area', '.', 'ok', 'ill', 'say', 'jock', 'itch', '.', 'no', 'matter', 'much', 'use', 'long', 'scrub', 'use', 'one', 'shower', 'gloves', 'bit', 'rough', 'texture', 'exfoliating', 'itch', 'quickly', 'returns', '.', 'usually', 'later', 'day', '.', 'helps', 'use', 'jock', 'itch', 'spray', 'shower', 'times', 'dont', 'want', 'spray', 'interfere', 'um', 'intimate', 'encounters', '.', 'looking', 'something', 'different', '.', 'shame', 'ive', 'got', 'darn', 'much', 'stuff', '.', 'two', 'large', 'bottles', 'great', 'value', 'worked', 'id', 'like', '.', 'doesnt', 'relieve', 'itch', 'well', 'id', 'like']"

being a big fan of brickells eye cream i was pretty stoked to try their body wash. i got the mint because ive liked other mintinfused body washes in the past and figured it was a pretty safe bet. what i didnt realize is that id end up liking this body wash better for 2 main reasons1. the mint isnt overpowering. unlike other brands ive tried i didnt feel like my man bits were getting freezerburnt as i scrubbed them down just cleaned. it was a gentle cool not like applying icy hot to my nethers.2. i felt really clean afterward. ive tried all different kinds of body wash and while some of them may lather better than this stuff once they rinse off you can often still feel a kind of slick film on your skin. the brickell rinsed off and left my skin feeling really clean without any residue. and it does it without drying out my skin. being in my later 40s thats becoming increasingly important to meif there was anything i felt could improve id say the scent while really pleasant could stand to be a little stronger. however i dont know if that would result in the aforementioned freezerburnt man bits. if thats the case i think they made the right choiceoverall i would recommend this body wash to any man looking for a great clean feeling without drying out or any slimy artificialfeeling residue. i dont think youll be disappointed that you gave it a try. gets the important things right.,big fan brickells eye cream pretty stoked try body wash. got mint ive liked mintinfused body washes past figured pretty safe bet . didnt realize id end liking body wash better 2 main reasons1 . mint isnt overpowering . unlike brands ive tried didnt feel like man bits getting freezerburnt scrubbed cleaned . gentle cool not like applying icy hot nethers.2 . felt really clean afterward . ive tried different kinds body wash may lather better stuff rinse often still feel kind slick film skin . brickell rinsed left skin feeling really clean without residue . without drying skin . later 40s thats becoming increasingly important meif anything felt could improve id say scent really pleasant could stand little stronger . however dont know would result aforementioned freezerburnt man bits . thats case think made right choiceoverall would recommend body wash man looking great clean feeling without drying slimy artificialfeeling residue . dont think youll disappointed gave try . gets important things right .,"['big', 'fan', 'brickells', 'eye', 'cream', 'pretty', 'stoked', 'try', 'body', 'wash.', 'got', 'mint', 'ive', 'liked', 'mintinfused', 'body', 'washes', 'past', 'figured', 'pretty', 'safe', 'bet', '.', 'didnt', 'realize', 'id', 'end', 'liking', 'body', 'wash', 'better', '2', 'main', 'reasons1', '.', 'mint', 'isnt', 'overpowering', '.', 'unlike', 'brands', 'ive', 'tried', 'didnt', 'feel', 'like', 'man', 'bits', 'getting', 'freezerburnt', 'scrubbed', 'cleaned', '.', 'gentle', 'cool', 'not', 'like', 'applying', 'icy', 'hot', 'nethers.2', '.', 'felt', 'really', 'clean', 'afterward', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'different', 'kinds', 'body', 'wash', 'may', 'lather', 'better', 'stuff', 'rinse', 'often', 'still', 'feel', 'kind', 'slick', 'film', 'skin', '.', 'brickell', 'rinsed', 'left', 'skin', 'feeling', 'really', 'clean', 'without', 'residue', '.', 'without', 'drying', 'skin', '.', 'later', '40s', 'thats', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'important', 'meif', 'anything', 'felt', 'could', 'improve', 'id', 'say', 'scent', 'really', 'pleasant', 'could', 'stand', 'little', 'stronger', '.', 'however', 'dont', 'know', 'would', 'result', 'aforementioned', 'freezerburnt', 'man', 'bits', '.', 'thats', 'case', 'think', 'made', 'right', 'choiceoverall', 'would', 'recommend', 'body', 'wash', 'man', 'looking', 'great', 'clean', 'feeling', 'without', 'drying', 'slimy', 'artificialfeeling', 'residue', '.', 'dont', 'think', 'youll', 'disappointed', 'gave', 'try', '.', 'gets', 'important', 'things', 'right', '.']"
overall this is a nice product. the bodywash works well does not leave a filmy feeling on the skin and smells nice too  although the scent does not really linger beyond the shower.i am not sure if washing implement makes a difference but its worth noting i am a wash cloth kind of guy not a sponge. anyway using a wash cloth the con here is i feel i need to use too much to get a good lather. a quarter sized amount didnt do the trick double it was too much so i ended up consistently using about a quarter and a halfs worth of the product. i am not sure if this is considered too much but to me the product loses value needing to use that much of it.otherwise if you like body washes this is a great choice when looking for cleaner ingredients a nonresidue afterwash feeling and a smell not too overpowering. good product but need to use a lot for a good lather.,overall nice product . bodywash works well not leave filmy feeling skin smells nice although scent not really linger beyond shower.i not sure washing implement makes difference worth noting wash cloth kind guy not sponge . anyway using wash cloth con feel need use much get good lather . quarter sized amount didnt trick double much ended consistently using quarter halfs worth product . not sure considered much product loses value needing use much it.otherwise like body washes great choice looking cleaner ingredients nonresidue afterwash feeling smell not overpowering . good product need use lot good lather .,"['overall', 'nice', 'product', '.', 'bodywash', 'works', 'well', 'not', 'leave', 'filmy', 'feeling', 'skin', 'smells', 'nice', 'although', 'scent', 'not', 'really', 'linger', 'beyond', 'shower.i', 'not', 'sure', 'washing', 'implement', 'makes', 'difference', 'worth', 'noting', 'wash', 'cloth', 'kind', 'guy', 'not', 'sponge', '.', 'anyway', 'using', 'wash', 'cloth', 'con', 'feel', 'need', 'use', 'much', 'get', 'good', 'lather', '.', 'quarter', 'sized', 'amount', 'didnt', 'trick', 'double', 'much', 'ended', 'consistently', 'using', 'quarter', 'halfs', 'worth', 'product', '.', 'not', 'sure', 'considered', 'much', 'product', 'loses', 'value', 'needing', 'use', 'much', 'it.otherwise', 'like', 'body', 'washes', 'great', 'choice', 'looking', 'cleaner', 'ingredients', 'nonresidue', 'afterwash', 'feeling', 'smell', 'not', 'overpowering', '.', 'good', 'product', 'need', 'use', 'lot', 'good', 'lather', '.']"

i have mixed feelings about this.  the smell is very strong.  you will smell like a eucalyptus tree when you are done showering.  some guys dont mind the outdoorsy scent though.  it was offputting at first but i kept using it since i spent so much money on it.  jack black products may be quality but they hurt my wallet.  i enjoy the turbo wash now but i will look forward to trying another scent later on.  there is a also a mild tingliing sensation you may feel in certain areas.  all in all my skin is always very dry and this has not dried it out like many products do and i dont feel sticky after using it either.  10oz sounds small but really it is not and it will last for quite sometime. expensive probably worth it but i wish they could improve the smell,mixed feelings . smell strong . smell like eucalyptus tree done showering . guys dont mind outdoorsy scent though . offputting first kept using since spent much money . jack black products may quality hurt wallet . enjoy turbo wash look forward trying another scent later . also mild tingliing sensation may feel certain areas . skin always dry not dried like many products dont feel sticky using either . 10oz sounds small really not last quite sometime . expensive probably worth wish could improve smell,"['mixed', 'feelings', '.', 'smell', 'strong', '.', 'smell', 'like', 'eucalyptus', 'tree', 'done', 'showering', '.', 'guys', 'dont', 'mind', 'outdoorsy', 'scent', 'though', '.', 'offputting', 'first', 'kept', 'using', 'since', 'spent', 'much', 'money', '.', 'jack', 'black', 'products', 'may', 'quality', 'hurt', 'wallet', '.', 'enjoy', 'turbo', 'wash', 'look', 'forward', 'trying', 'another', 'scent', 'later', '.', 'also', 'mild', 'tingliing', 'sensation', 'may', 'feel', 'certain', 'areas', '.', 'skin', 'always', 'dry', 'not', 'dried', 'like', 'many', 'products', 'dont', 'feel', 'sticky', 'using', 'either', '.', '10oz', 'sounds', 'small', 'really', 'not', 'last', 'quite', 'sometime', '.', 'expensive', 'probably', 'worth', 'wish', 'could', 'improve', 'smell']"

i heard a lot about jack black.  this was one brand of body wash that was highly rated among a few others.  the smell is awesome that many hours after showering not only does my body smell great but my bathroom smells great with this stuff.  this product is so concentrated that you save money in the long run compared with using soap bars.  i just use two pumps of this stuff and it goes a long way.  i highly recommend using this with a mesh sponge because if you use a regular cotton wash cloth it ends up soaking all of the soap and it gets wasted.  i recommend dispensing two pumps of this in a tall plastic cup and fill it up with water stir it up a bit then dip the mesh sponge and scrub different parts of your body with it dipping the mesh in a few times as you go.  i also recommend not running the shower head as you apply the soap because the water will just rinse the soap off before it has a chance to clean. awesome smell and save money,heard lot jack black . one brand body wash highly rated among others . smell awesome many hours showering not body smell great bathroom smells great stuff . product concentrated save money long run compared using soap bars . use two pumps stuff goes long way . highly recommend using mesh sponge use regular cotton wash cloth ends soaking soap gets wasted . recommend dispensing two pumps tall plastic cup fill water stir bit dip mesh sponge scrub different parts body dipping mesh times go . also recommend not running shower head apply soap water rinse soap chance clean . awesome smell save money,"['heard', 'lot', 'jack', 'black', '.', 'one', 'brand', 'body', 'wash', 'highly', 'rated', 'among', 'others', '.', 'smell', 'awesome', 'many', 'hours', 'showering', 'not', 'body', 'smell', 'great', 'bathroom', 'smells', 'great', 'stuff', '.', 'product', 'concentrated', 'save', 'money', 'long', 'run', 'compared', 'using', 'soap', 'bars', '.', 'use', 'two', 'pumps', 'stuff', 'goes', 'long', 'way', '.', 'highly', 'recommend', 'using', 'mesh', 'sponge', 'use', 'regular', 'cotton', 'wash', 'cloth', 'ends', 'soaking', 'soap', 'gets', 'wasted', '.', 'recommend', 'dispensing', 'two', 'pumps', 'tall', 'plastic', 'cup', 'fill', 'water', 'stir', 'bit', 'dip', 'mesh', 'sponge', 'scrub', 'different', 'parts', 'body', 'dipping', 'mesh', 'times', 'go', '.', 'also', 'recommend', 'not', 'running', 'shower', 'head', 'apply', 'soap', 'water', 'rinse', 'soap', 'chance', 'clean', '.', 'awesome', 'smell', 'save', 'money']"

i have been using turbo for a couple years now. the eucalyptus is what hooked me. also the soap washes off pretty easily without a  residue. the smell though is transformative. it elevates your showering experience. when i was a kid the smell i loved was irish spring bar soap. with turbo youre a more refined homosapien. using it reminds me of being in a resort spa and helps me temporarily forget my torn shower curtain cracked tub semi clogged drain and the view from my bathroom window showing my neighbors junk yard collection of rusted patio furniture. buy this ,using turbo couple years . eucalyptus hooked . also soap washes pretty easily without residue . smell though transformative . elevates showering experience . kid smell loved irish spring bar soap . turbo youre refined homosapien . using reminds resort spa helps temporarily forget torn shower curtain cracked tub semi clogged drain view bathroom window showing neighbors junk yard collection rusted patio furniture . buy,"['using', 'turbo', 'couple', 'years', '.', 'eucalyptus', 'hooked', '.', 'also', 'soap', 'washes', 'pretty', 'easily', 'without', 'residue', '.', 'smell', 'though', 'transformative', '.', 'elevates', 'showering', 'experience', '.', 'kid', 'smell', 'loved', 'irish', 'spring', 'bar', 'soap', '.', 'turbo', 'youre', 'refined', 'homosapien', '.', 'using', 'reminds', 'resort', 'spa', 'helps', 'temporarily', 'forget', 'torn', 'shower', 'curtain', 'cracked', 'tub', 'semi', 'clogged', 'drain', 'view', 'bathroom', 'window', 'showing', 'neighbors', 'junk', 'yard', 'collection', 'rusted', 'patio', 'furniture', '.', 'buy']"

it seems as though this product is supposed to be for men but i love it. even though it sounds like something one would use to clean engines this is far from what i found. as a woman however i would caution that with euclalyptus one may want to use care around sensitive areas but if youre looking for the most refreshing energizing and calming shower experience of your life get some   someone called it morning coffee for the body.  i agree. a sense of well being and i can do this comes over you almost instantly.  the fragrance is subtle and i would think generally pleasing not medicinal at all and leaves only a fresh clean smell after.  what was somewhat surprising was pain relief as i gently rubbed two sore arms. can it get better  yes their lip balm is the best ive ever tried at any price and its spf 25 too  and i just ordered the soothing balm.  i am so happy i discovered this and am now a convert.  as always amazon got it to me quickly and ill be back for more.  would make a wonderful gift for the person who has everything   if they dont have this theyre missing something great. heres an idea get some for your significant other and use it yourself. a win win. spa in a  bottle. envigorating but relaxing with pain relief and a fresh smell too yes,seems though product supposed men love . even though sounds like something one would use clean engines far found . woman however would caution euclalyptus one may want use care around sensitive areas youre looking refreshing energizing calming shower experience life get someone called morning coffee body . agree . sense well comes almost instantly . fragrance subtle would think generally pleasing not medicinal leaves fresh clean smell . somewhat surprising pain relief gently rubbed two sore arms . get better yes lip balm best ive ever tried price spf 25 ordered soothing balm . happy discovered convert . always amazon got quickly ill back . would make wonderful gift person everything dont theyre missing something great . heres idea get significant use . win win . spa bottle . envigorating relaxing pain relief fresh smell yes,"['seems', 'though', 'product', 'supposed', 'men', 'love', '.', 'even', 'though', 'sounds', 'like', 'something', 'one', 'would', 'use', 'clean', 'engines', 'far', 'found', '.', 'woman', 'however', 'would', 'caution', 'euclalyptus', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'use', 'care', 'around', 'sensitive', 'areas', 'youre', 'looking', 'refreshing', 'energizing', 'calming', 'shower', 'experience', 'life', 'get', 'someone', 'called', 'morning', 'coffee', 'body', '.', 'agree', '.', 'sense', 'well', 'comes', 'almost', 'instantly', '.', 'fragrance', 'subtle', 'would', 'think', 'generally', 'pleasing', 'not', 'medicinal', 'leaves', 'fresh', 'clean', 'smell', '.', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'pain', 'relief', 'gently', 'rubbed', 'two', 'sore', 'arms', '.', 'get', 'better', 'yes', 'lip', 'balm', 'best', 'ive', 'ever', 'tried', 'price', 'spf', '25', 'ordered', 'soothing', 'balm', '.', 'happy', 'discovered', 'convert', '.', 'always', 'amazon', 'got', 'quickly', 'ill', 'back', '.', 'would', 'make', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'person', 'everything', 'dont', 'theyre', 'missing', 'something', 'great', '.', 'heres', 'idea', 'get', 'significant', 'use', '.', 'win', 'win', '.', 'spa', 'bottle', '.', 'envigorating', 'relaxing', 'pain', 'relief', 'fresh', 'smell', 'yes']"

i bought a small version of this as a little present to myself last year despite the price and found it is actually much cheaper then going through multiple bottles of dove body wash as one squirt of this turbo wash lasts an entire shower for body and hair. one bottle lasts me well over 6 months and can go a year if you take it out of the shower with you so other people in your house dont use it because they will they say they dont but they do. i know i can smell it when you get out of the shower bro. anyway i dont know about energizing but the stuff has a fantastic manly smell that blends well with normal body odor and smells natural. ive found it doesnt dry my hair and skin out like normal shampoo soap or body wash so this one has been a keeper the last 2 years. tried to leave it for something cheaper but regretted it immediately.the bottle is great too and works well for traveling compared to other body washes that seemed to explode in my suitcase. anyway i dont know about energizing but the stuff has a fantastic manly smell that blends well with normal body odor .,bought small version little present last year despite price found actually much cheaper going multiple bottles dove body wash one squirt turbo wash lasts entire shower body hair . one bottle lasts well 6 months go year take shower people house dont use say dont . know smell get shower bro . anyway dont know energizing stuff fantastic manly smell blends well normal body odor smells natural . ive found doesnt dry hair skin like normal shampoo soap body wash one keeper last 2 years . tried leave something cheaper regretted immediately.the bottle great works well traveling compared body washes seemed explode suitcase . anyway dont know energizing stuff fantastic manly smell blends well normal body odor .,"['bought', 'small', 'version', 'little', 'present', 'last', 'year', 'despite', 'price', 'found', 'actually', 'much', 'cheaper', 'going', 'multiple', 'bottles', 'dove', 'body', 'wash', 'one', 'squirt', 'turbo', 'wash', 'lasts', 'entire', 'shower', 'body', 'hair', '.', 'one', 'bottle', 'lasts', 'well', '6', 'months', 'go', 'year', 'take', 'shower', 'people', 'house', 'dont', 'use', 'say', 'dont', '.', 'know', 'smell', 'get', 'shower', 'bro', '.', 'anyway', 'dont', 'know', 'energizing', 'stuff', 'fantastic', 'manly', 'smell', 'blends', 'well', 'normal', 'body', 'odor', 'smells', 'natural', '.', 'ive', 'found', 'doesnt', 'dry', 'hair', 'skin', 'like', 'normal', 'shampoo', 'soap', 'body', 'wash', 'one', 'keeper', 'last', '2', 'years', '.', 'tried', 'leave', 'something', 'cheaper', 'regretted', 'immediately.the', 'bottle', 'great', 'works', 'well', 'traveling', 'compared', 'body', 'washes', 'seemed', 'explode', 'suitcase', '.', 'anyway', 'dont', 'know', 'energizing', 'stuff', 'fantastic', 'manly', 'smell', 'blends', 'well', 'normal', 'body', 'odor', '.']"

tried this as a solution for dry skin and bump breakouts after having tried numerous washes that were supposed to be hydrating or did not use lauryl sulfate. almost all of them had no foam and  felt like i was using nothing in most cases it basically felt like i was just washing with water which made me feel like i wasnt getting clean and in turn led to me probably using more than i needed. as mentioned by other reviewers the jack black wash also does not foam a lot but it does have a thickness to it that feels like you are actually using a soap and did not feel the need to use more than a little every time.after two weeks of use without using any moisturizers after showering my skin is less dry and the breakouts have disappeared. dryness on my face had gotten to a point where i was staring to get cracking around the eyes but a week with the wash helped clear that up. my skin feels much more refreshed after showering but no tingling like with a lot of other washes. only negative i can say is that i have a smell that reminds me of a locker room but it only lasts about 30min and then is gone so big deal.have not used on my hair but have used on a really tough coarse goatee that requires oil to soften up. the wash does not completely do the job of softening like the oil does but it has done enough to soften it that i will continue to use. was great for dry skin and tough facial hair,tried solution dry skin bump breakouts tried numerous washes supposed hydrating not use lauryl sulfate . almost no foam felt like using nothing cases basically felt like washing water made feel like wasnt getting clean turn led probably using needed . mentioned reviewers jack black wash also not foam lot thickness feels like actually using soap not feel need use little every time.after two weeks use without using moisturizers showering skin less dry breakouts disappeared . dryness face gotten point staring get cracking around eyes week wash helped clear . skin feels much refreshed showering no tingling like lot washes . negative say smell reminds locker room lasts 30min gone big deal.have not used hair used really tough coarse goatee requires oil soften . wash not completely job softening like oil done enough soften continue use . great dry skin tough facial hair,"['tried', 'solution', 'dry', 'skin', 'bump', 'breakouts', 'tried', 'numerous', 'washes', 'supposed', 'hydrating', 'not', 'use', 'lauryl', 'sulfate', '.', 'almost', 'no', 'foam', 'felt', 'like', 'using', 'nothing', 'cases', 'basically', 'felt', 'like', 'washing', 'water', 'made', 'feel', 'like', 'wasnt', 'getting', 'clean', 'turn', 'led', 'probably', 'using', 'needed', '.', 'mentioned', 'reviewers', 'jack', 'black', 'wash', 'also', 'not', 'foam', 'lot', 'thickness', 'feels', 'like', 'actually', 'using', 'soap', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'use', 'little', 'every', 'time.after', 'two', 'weeks', 'use', 'without', 'using', 'moisturizers', 'showering', 'skin', 'less', 'dry', 'breakouts', 'disappeared', '.', 'dryness', 'face', 'gotten', 'point', 'staring', 'get', 'cracking', 'around', 'eyes', 'week', 'wash', 'helped', 'clear', '.', 'skin', 'feels', 'much', 'refreshed', 'showering', 'no', 'tingling', 'like', 'lot', 'washes', '.', 'negative', 'say', 'smell', 'reminds', 'locker', 'room', 'lasts', '30min', 'gone', 'big', 'deal.have', 'not', 'used', 'hair', 'used', 'really', 'tough', 'coarse', 'goatee', 'requires', 'oil', 'soften', '.', 'wash', 'not', 'completely', 'job', 'softening', 'like', 'oil', 'done', 'enough', 'soften', 'continue', 'use', '.', 'great', 'dry', 'skin', 'tough', 'facial', 'hair']"

i use this only as a shampoo. i suffered from scalp eczema and from experimentation found out that the problem was the sodium laurel sulfatesls which is a common ingredient in many shampoos. found out if i stay away from shampoos with this ingredient my eczema problem disappears. of course this is not the only shampoo without sls but i liked the fragrance better than the tea tree trader joes shampoo that is also sls free. it does have a strong fragrance of rosemary eucalyptus and juniper so you may want to try a small bottle to see if that is something you would like. but i use it as a shampoo only and not as a body wash so i do not find the fragrance overwhelming. it is pricey but not too bad if you get the 33 oz bottle. in general shampoos without sls seem to be more expensive. i did have problems with the bottle leaking during shipping but amazon has gotten better about shipping it in a plastic bag and taping the top but some stuff usually oozes out. still this seems to be a generic problem with how all liquid products are packaged. manufacturers seems to assume that the bottle will stay vertical during shipping and most caps are not designed to be leak proof when bottle is horizontal for long periods and being jostled about by ups. bottles with the pump seem to be more susceptible to leakage. the amount of leakage has been minimal and the online prices still make it a better deal purchasing it online. no sls and liked fragrance,use shampoo . suffered scalp eczema experimentation found problem sodium laurel sulfatesls common ingredient many shampoos . found stay away shampoos ingredient eczema problem disappears . course not shampoo without sls liked fragrance better tea tree trader joes shampoo also sls free . strong fragrance rosemary eucalyptus juniper may want try small bottle see something would like . use shampoo not body wash not find fragrance overwhelming . pricey not bad get 33 oz bottle . general shampoos without sls seem expensive . problems bottle leaking shipping amazon gotten better shipping plastic bag taping top stuff usually oozes . still seems generic problem liquid products packaged . manufacturers seems assume bottle stay vertical shipping caps not designed leak proof bottle horizontal long periods jostled ups . bottles pump seem susceptible leakage . amount leakage minimal online prices still make better deal purchasing online . no sls liked fragrance,"['use', 'shampoo', '.', 'suffered', 'scalp', 'eczema', 'experimentation', 'found', 'problem', 'sodium', 'laurel', 'sulfatesls', 'common', 'ingredient', 'many', 'shampoos', '.', 'found', 'stay', 'away', 'shampoos', 'ingredient', 'eczema', 'problem', 'disappears', '.', 'course', 'not', 'shampoo', 'without', 'sls', 'liked', 'fragrance', 'better', 'tea', 'tree', 'trader', 'joes', 'shampoo', 'also', 'sls', 'free', '.', 'strong', 'fragrance', 'rosemary', 'eucalyptus', 'juniper', 'may', 'want', 'try', 'small', 'bottle', 'see', 'something', 'would', 'like', '.', 'use', 'shampoo', 'not', 'body', 'wash', 'not', 'find', 'fragrance', 'overwhelming', '.', 'pricey', 'not', 'bad', 'get', '33', 'oz', 'bottle', '.', 'general', 'shampoos', 'without', 'sls', 'seem', 'expensive', '.', 'problems', 'bottle', 'leaking', 'shipping', 'amazon', 'gotten', 'better', 'shipping', 'plastic', 'bag', 'taping', 'top', 'stuff', 'usually', 'oozes', '.', 'still', 'seems', 'generic', 'problem', 'liquid', 'products', 'packaged', '.', 'manufacturers', 'seems', 'assume', 'bottle', 'stay', 'vertical', 'shipping', 'caps', 'not', 'designed', 'leak', 'proof', 'bottle', 'horizontal', 'long', 'periods', 'jostled', 'ups', '.', 'bottles', 'pump', 'seem', 'susceptible', 'leakage', '.', 'amount', 'leakage', 'minimal', 'online', 'prices', 'still', 'make', 'better', 'deal', 'purchasing', 'online', '.', 'no', 'sls', 'liked', 'fragrance']"

im a satisfied user of other jack black products and when it came time to buy some new shampoo i decided to give this stuff a shot because it was a shampoo and a body wash. as other reviews have stated it does have a unique smell to it but it isnt overpowering and doesnt stick around too long after use. it lathers up nicely and just a pump of it does the trick for going across the body i do a smaller pump for when im washing my hair. all in all this is a solid product albeit a bit on the pricier side but you are paying for a quality product.id like to add two other things about my experience the picture advertises it as a whiteblue bottle but the bottle i received was blue all around doesnt matter to me  just a note. also upon opening the box i could smell a strong odor coming out of it because it had been pumped out all over the box. im not sure how it comes out of the factory but typically products that have pumps on them need to be opened before the pump dispenses anything. needless to say it had pumped out all over the other purchases that i had made that came in the box with this product. luckily they were also bathing products so just washing it off was no big deal at all but it could have been a real mess if i had other products coming in the same box that werent meant to be washed. ,im satisfied user jack black products came time buy new shampoo decided give stuff shot shampoo body wash. reviews stated unique smell isnt overpowering doesnt stick around long use . lathers nicely pump trick going across body smaller pump im washing hair . solid product albeit bit pricier side paying quality product.id like add two things experience picture advertises whiteblue bottle bottle received blue around doesnt matter note . also upon opening box could smell strong odor coming pumped box . im not sure comes factory typically products pumps need opened pump dispenses anything . needless say pumped purchases made came box product . luckily also bathing products washing no big deal could real mess products coming box werent meant washed .,"['im', 'satisfied', 'user', 'jack', 'black', 'products', 'came', 'time', 'buy', 'new', 'shampoo', 'decided', 'give', 'stuff', 'shot', 'shampoo', 'body', 'wash.', 'reviews', 'stated', 'unique', 'smell', 'isnt', 'overpowering', 'doesnt', 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'use', '.', 'lathers', 'nicely', 'pump', 'trick', 'going', 'across', 'body', 'smaller', 'pump', 'im', 'washing', 'hair', '.', 'solid', 'product', 'albeit', 'bit', 'pricier', 'side', 'paying', 'quality', 'product.id', 'like', 'add', 'two', 'things', 'experience', 'picture', 'advertises', 'whiteblue', 'bottle', 'bottle', 'received', 'blue', 'around', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'note', '.', 'also', 'upon', 'opening', 'box', 'could', 'smell', 'strong', 'odor', 'coming', 'pumped', 'box', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'comes', 'factory', 'typically', 'products', 'pumps', 'need', 'opened', 'pump', 'dispenses', 'anything', '.', 'needless', 'say', 'pumped', 'purchases', 'made', 'came', 'box', 'product', '.', 'luckily', 'also', 'bathing', 'products', 'washing', 'no', 'big', 'deal', 'could', 'real', 'mess', 'products', 'coming', 'box', 'werent', 'meant', 'washed', '.']"

great shower gel product however the latest dispenser pump update is a joke. the original pump was a far better design and worked well. jb should not have fixed something this did need fixing the new pump is a wide mouth delivery pump that seriously lacks in function. the distance from the container is reduced causing difficulty in placing hand under the spout to collect the pumped fluid. secondly the pump quality is not up to grade. the pump fails to raise under the force of the return spring as it is too weak to return the actuator the highest starting position. for this reason it fails to pump correctly and actually gets stuck at the stop position with each pump. jb please return to using the original pump design it is way more effective now new pump fitting has changed and you cannot switch out the older pump heads. you are doomed  your only option now is to pour the new product into your old container with older pump head to enjoy your shower no sale this time. do not buy until pump design issue is fixed. get with the program jack . turbo tap pump update,great shower gel product however latest dispenser pump update joke . original pump far better design worked well . jb not fixed something need fixing new pump wide mouth delivery pump seriously lacks function . distance container reduced causing difficulty placing hand spout collect pumped fluid . secondly pump quality not grade . pump fails raise force return spring weak return actuator highest starting position . reason fails pump correctly actually gets stuck stop position pump . jb please return using original pump design way effective new pump fitting changed not switch older pump heads . doomed option pour new product old container older pump head enjoy shower no sale time . not buy pump design issue fixed . get program jack . turbo tap pump update,"['great', 'shower', 'gel', 'product', 'however', 'latest', 'dispenser', 'pump', 'update', 'joke', '.', 'original', 'pump', 'far', 'better', 'design', 'worked', 'well', '.', 'jb', 'not', 'fixed', 'something', 'need', 'fixing', 'new', 'pump', 'wide', 'mouth', 'delivery', 'pump', 'seriously', 'lacks', 'function', '.', 'distance', 'container', 'reduced', 'causing', 'difficulty', 'placing', 'hand', 'spout', 'collect', 'pumped', 'fluid', '.', 'secondly', 'pump', 'quality', 'not', 'grade', '.', 'pump', 'fails', 'raise', 'force', 'return', 'spring', 'weak', 'return', 'actuator', 'highest', 'starting', 'position', '.', 'reason', 'fails', 'pump', 'correctly', 'actually', 'gets', 'stuck', 'stop', 'position', 'pump', '.', 'jb', 'please', 'return', 'using', 'original', 'pump', 'design', 'way', 'effective', 'new', 'pump', 'fitting', 'changed', 'not', 'switch', 'older', 'pump', 'heads', '.', 'doomed', 'option', 'pour', 'new', 'product', 'old', 'container', 'older', 'pump', 'head', 'enjoy', 'shower', 'no', 'sale', 'time', '.', 'not', 'buy', 'pump', 'design', 'issue', 'fixed', '.', 'get', 'program', 'jack', '.', 'turbo', 'tap', 'pump', 'update']"

ill start this off by saying i typically use paul mitchell tea tree shampoo and conditioner and whatever random body wash. i originally ordered a small size of turbo wash for a test run. i liked it so much i bought the full size. i live in south florida where often a layer of sweat is unavoidable. its amazing how well this product cleans both hair and body. but it does not seem to over dry which can result in your body over producing oil to which im extremely sensitive of on my head. i purchased the big bottle on the first of january and now on the 1st of may i still have maybe another 2 weeks left of two pumps one for hair one for body. the scent is definitely masculine but in no way obnoxious or overpowering.i dont even have to use a conditioner the cleaning it does is gentle enough to not leave your hair stripped to which my salon preferred paul mitchell will definitely do without the conditioner. ,ill start saying typically use paul mitchell tea tree shampoo conditioner whatever random body wash. originally ordered small size turbo wash test run . liked much bought full size . live south florida often layer sweat unavoidable . amazing well product cleans hair body . not seem dry result body producing oil im extremely sensitive head . purchased big bottle first january 1st may still maybe another 2 weeks left two pumps one hair one body . scent definitely masculine no way obnoxious overpowering.i dont even use conditioner cleaning gentle enough not leave hair stripped salon preferred paul mitchell definitely without conditioner .,"['ill', 'start', 'saying', 'typically', 'use', 'paul', 'mitchell', 'tea', 'tree', 'shampoo', 'conditioner', 'whatever', 'random', 'body', 'wash.', 'originally', 'ordered', 'small', 'size', 'turbo', 'wash', 'test', 'run', '.', 'liked', 'much', 'bought', 'full', 'size', '.', 'live', 'south', 'florida', 'often', 'layer', 'sweat', 'unavoidable', '.', 'amazing', 'well', 'product', 'cleans', 'hair', 'body', '.', 'not', 'seem', 'dry', 'result', 'body', 'producing', 'oil', 'im', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'head', '.', 'purchased', 'big', 'bottle', 'first', 'january', '1st', 'may', 'still', 'maybe', 'another', '2', 'weeks', 'left', 'two', 'pumps', 'one', 'hair', 'one', 'body', '.', 'scent', 'definitely', 'masculine', 'no', 'way', 'obnoxious', 'overpowering.i', 'dont', 'even', 'use', 'conditioner', 'cleaning', 'gentle', 'enough', 'not', 'leave', 'hair', 'stripped', 'salon', 'preferred', 'paul', 'mitchell', 'definitely', 'without', 'conditioner', '.']"

kicking this off by saying im somewhat of a body wash snob within reason.  this is now and has been my goto and i have yet to be deterred even though i go off and spend way more money on others  for instance aesop aveda for men anthony the groomed man co. to name a few  not that any of them are bad they are actually quite wonderful  but none do quite the same job as turbo wash.why  firstly in a pinch it can be used on all parts of the body including the hair i am a person who always uses separate shampoo use and rinse conditioner use and leave in until body wash done followed by body wash then rinse out conditioner  but its brilliant to know that if for some reason i need only one product to rule them all i can use this  which obviously in my case a 33oz bottle is terrible for travel but you can squirt some into a container and have a 3in1 at the ready.secondly its eucalyptus and mint which is a ubiquitous spa scent and this does it well  leaves me feeling relaxed and clean.thirdly it suds up super nicely usually just one or two squirts and thats all thats needed.  rinses cleanly and doesnt leave a residue.sure its not cheap but it is fantastically versatile reliable and does exactly what it should do  clean you.  with options to clean more of you.  highly recommended. ,kicking saying im somewhat body wash snob within reason . goto yet deterred even though go spend way money others instance aesop aveda men anthony groomed man co. name not bad actually quite wonderful none quite job turbo wash.why firstly pinch used parts body including hair person always uses separate shampoo use rinse conditioner use leave body wash done followed body wash rinse conditioner brilliant know reason need one product rule use obviously case 33oz bottle terrible travel squirt container 3in1 ready.secondly eucalyptus mint ubiquitous spa scent well leaves feeling relaxed clean.thirdly suds super nicely usually one two squirts thats thats needed . rinses cleanly doesnt leave residue.sure not cheap fantastically versatile reliable exactly clean . options clean . highly recommended .,"['kicking', 'saying', 'im', 'somewhat', 'body', 'wash', 'snob', 'within', 'reason', '.', 'goto', 'yet', 'deterred', 'even', 'though', 'go', 'spend', 'way', 'money', 'others', 'instance', 'aesop', 'aveda', 'men', 'anthony', 'groomed', 'man', 'co.', 'name', 'not', 'bad', 'actually', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'none', 'quite', 'job', 'turbo', 'wash.why', 'firstly', 'pinch', 'used', 'parts', 'body', 'including', 'hair', 'person', 'always', 'uses', 'separate', 'shampoo', 'use', 'rinse', 'conditioner', 'use', 'leave', 'body', 'wash', 'done', 'followed', 'body', 'wash', 'rinse', 'conditioner', 'brilliant', 'know', 'reason', 'need', 'one', 'product', 'rule', 'use', 'obviously', 'case', '33oz', 'bottle', 'terrible', 'travel', 'squirt', 'container', '3in1', 'ready.secondly', 'eucalyptus', 'mint', 'ubiquitous', 'spa', 'scent', 'well', 'leaves', 'feeling', 'relaxed', 'clean.thirdly', 'suds', 'super', 'nicely', 'usually', 'one', 'two', 'squirts', 'thats', 'thats', 'needed', '.', 'rinses', 'cleanly', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'residue.sure', 'not', 'cheap', 'fantastically', 'versatile', 'reliable', 'exactly', 'clean', '.', 'options', 'clean', '.', 'highly', 'recommended', '.']"
i was not optimistic about this product.  ive never had exceptional experiences with allinone bath products and as big sweaty oily thick haired dude i need something that works consistently and without fuss.  plus after being married recently ive grown accustomed to my wifes salongrade shampoo and i didnt think an allinone could come close.but after several separate recommendations from friends and reading the reviews i bought the smallest tube and decided to give it a try.now im in love.now it may not seem like this would save much time.and it doesnt not really but it does make it nice and easy to take a couple of pumps wash your hair and use the remainder to easily wash your body.  when im in a rush in the morning okay  every morning its perfect a onestop shop and im done.the smell is fantastic.  eucalyptus and juniper like youd get in at a spa or nice gym actually.  i dont use it right before bed as my wife dislikes strong scents and describes the smell as peppery.  but thats fine this is mainly a morning product for me.jack black has done a great job here creating a scent that is masculine but unique and not musky.  its a luxury smell is what it is.the most important part the cleaning abilities are great.  the product doesnt leave my hair as silky smooth as my wifes 25bottle shampoos.  but its close and certainly doesnt leave the residues or squeakiness you get from lowerend shampoos.  it would be worth quite a bit as a shampoo itself.as a body wash however i have no complaints at all.  theres not a bodywash in existence thatll keep me clean and sweet for more than a few hours but this is as good as any of them.  again theres no residue. its easy to wash and lather and it removes sweat and oil completely without drying you out.  thats about all i can ask.its expensive.  people may downplay that.  nope its still expensive.  thats going to be your call  how much do you want to spend on this kind of thing.  i will say that the large bottle lasts me a heavy user about 2.5 months.  i can stomach spending 50 for a good bath product that will last that long.oh did i mention it smells great the allinone that won this cynic over,not optimistic product . ive never exceptional experiences allinone bath products big sweaty oily thick haired dude need something works consistently without fuss . plus married recently ive grown

if you only read one thing i write for this review its this   jack black turbo wash is amazing.i always laughed at the idea of spending a bit more on a soap until i tried a free sample. it really is that good and the older i get the more i realized that like most men i wasnt taking care of my skin the way i really should. so take care of your skin no matter what you buy guys.fist it just smells amazing the scent is fresh light and eye opening. this soap really does wake you up and not just the smell your skin almost tingles and just feels fresh and awake.also to anyone with seasonal allergies youll appreciate that this soap actually helps to open you up in the mornings. the eucalyptus has an almost menthol type cooling effect but once combined with other ingredients smells great too.ive noticed several complaints about the bottles being open or giving trouble. i have no reason to not believe those customers but i can only say that nothing has ever been delivered to me damaged or leaking.on top of that the containers they use are pretty tough and high quality not the typical cheap throw away plastic you normally get. best soap ive ever used bar none,read one thing write review jack black turbo wash amazing.i always laughed idea spending bit soap tried free sample . really good older get realized like men wasnt taking care skin way really . take care skin no matter buy guys.fist smells amazing scent fresh light eye opening . soap really wake not smell skin almost tingles feels fresh awake.also anyone seasonal allergies youll appreciate soap actually helps open mornings . eucalyptus almost menthol type cooling effect combined ingredients smells great too.ive noticed several complaints bottles open giving trouble . no reason not believe customers say nothing ever delivered damaged leaking.on top containers use pretty tough high quality not typical cheap throw away plastic normally get . best soap ive ever used bar none,"['read', 'one', 'thing', 'write', 'review', 'jack', 'black', 'turbo', 'wash', 'amazing.i', 'always', 'laughed', 'idea', 'spending', 'bit', 'soap', 'tried', 'free', 'sample', '.', 'really', 'good', 'older', 'get', 'realized', 'like', 'men', 'wasnt', 'taking', 'care', 'skin', 'way', 'really', '.', 'take', 'care', 'skin', 'no', 'matter', 'buy', 'guys.fist', 'smells', 'amazing', 'scent', 'fresh', 'light', 'eye', 'opening', '.', 'soap', 'really', 'wake', 'not', 'smell', 'skin', 'almost', 'tingles', 'feels', 'fresh', 'awake.also', 'anyone', 'seasonal', 'allergies', 'youll', 'appreciate', 'soap', 'actually', 'helps', 'open', 'mornings', '.', 'eucalyptus', 'almost', 'menthol', 'type', 'cooling', 'effect', 'combined', 'ingredients', 'smells', 'great', 'too.ive', 'noticed', 'several', 'complaints', 'bottles', 'open', 'giving', 'trouble', '.', 'no', 'reason', 'not', 'believe', 'customers', 'say', 'nothing', 'ever', 'delivered', 'damaged', 'leaking.on', 'top', 'containers', 'use', 'pretty', 'tough', 'high', 'quality', 'not', 'typical', 'cheap', 'throw', 'away', 'plastic', 'normally', 'get', '.', 'best', 'soap', 'ive', 'ever', 'used', 'bar', 'none']"

i like to minimize the time and effort i spend on grooming but still have a preference for natural products whenever feasible.  this product is a home run for me.first its both a hair and body wash which leads to very efficient showering since the whole body can be lathered scrubbed and rinsed as one process rather than using one product here another product there.second the ingredients are topnotch with a focus on natural and organic elements  and no parabens or sulfates.third the scent is pleasant but mild.  i do not like being artificially scented going so far as to use unscented deodorant laundry detergentfabric softener etc.  this product has a clean refreshing natural scent which does not linger.put all that together and im in.  im looking forward to trying other jack black products as well and if they come close to the quality of this stuff then ill be happy.on a side note my wife has lamented the fact that they dont make a womans version of this because she tried it and liked it except for the manly or at least nonwomanly scent.  so if anybody from the company is reading this if you were to make a version of this stuff with a prettier scent you could also sell it to my wife ,like minimize time effort spend grooming still preference natural products whenever feasible . product home run me.first hair body wash leads efficient showering since whole body lathered scrubbed rinsed one process rather using one product another product there.second ingredients topnotch focus natural organic elements no parabens sulfates.third scent pleasant mild . not like artificially scented going far use unscented deodorant laundry detergentfabric softener etc . product clean refreshing natural scent not linger.put together im . im looking forward trying jack black products well come close quality stuff ill happy.on side note wife lamented fact dont make womans version tried liked except manly least nonwomanly scent . anybody company reading make version stuff prettier scent could also sell wife,"['like', 'minimize', 'time', 'effort', 'spend', 'grooming', 'still', 'preference', 'natural', 'products', 'whenever', 'feasible', '.', 'product', 'home', 'run', 'me.first', 'hair', 'body', 'wash', 'leads', 'efficient', 'showering', 'since', 'whole', 'body', 'lathered', 'scrubbed', 'rinsed', 'one', 'process', 'rather', 'using', 'one', 'product', 'another', 'product', 'there.second', 'ingredients', 'topnotch', 'focus', 'natural', 'organic', 'elements', 'no', 'parabens', 'sulfates.third', 'scent', 'pleasant', 'mild', '.', 'not', 'like', 'artificially', 'scented', 'going', 'far', 'use', 'unscented', 'deodorant', 'laundry', 'detergentfabric', 'softener', 'etc', '.', 'product', 'clean', 'refreshing', 'natural', 'scent', 'not', 'linger.put', 'together', 'im', '.', 'im', 'looking', 'forward', 'trying', 'jack', 'black', 'products', 'well', 'come', 'close', 'quality', 'stuff', 'ill', 'happy.on', 'side', 'note', 'wife', 'lamented', 'fact', 'dont', 'make', 'womans', 'version', 'tried', 'liked', 'except', 'manly', 'least', 'nonwomanly', 'scent', '.', 'anybody', 'company', 'reading', 'make', 'version', 'stuff', 'prettier', 'scent', 'could', 'also', 'sell', 'wife']"
i have always been a fan of jack black products though not because of their lip balm but rather their shave essentials. i had found this at nordstrom and ended up buying from amazon to try. i had grown used to using a shampoo and a body wash and a face wash all separately so i thought a combination product would speed up my normal routine. here are my thoughtsas a shampoo it smells great all around more like herbs than cleaner like the grocery store brand. it lathers richly and covers easily and leaves the hair clean and workable but it doesnt strip the hair. five stars as a shampoo.as a body wash smells great again. it lathers richly and generously especially on a sponge. i only need about a quarter sized drop to do both hair and body. it leaves the skin feeling clean and refreshed slightly cool but not stripped and squeaky. five stars as a body wash.as a facial cleanser we know it smells great and lathers well but the problem for me was that it left a bit of residual oil and i ended up sticking with my normal cleanser from kiehls.this is a great product and based on usage isnt actually that expensive. if you think youd like to try it start with the small size and work up to the pump bottle which has lasted me eight months so far and still going strong. great product that you should try,always fan jack black products though not lip balm rather shave essentials . found nordstrom ended buying amazon try . grown used using shampoo body wash face wash separately thought combination product would speed normal routine . thoughtsas shampoo smells great around like herbs cleaner like grocery store brand . lathers richly covers easily leaves hair clean workable doesnt strip hair . five stars shampoo.as body wash smells great . lathers richly generously especially sponge . need quarter sized drop hair body . leaves skin feeling clean refreshed slightly cool not stripped squeaky . five stars body wash.as facial cleanser know smells great lathers well problem left bit residual oil ended sticking normal cleanser kiehls.this great product based usage isnt actually expensive . think youd like try start small size work pump bottle lasted eight months far still going strong . great product try,"['always', 'fan', 'jack', 'black', 'products', 'though', 'not', 'lip', 'balm', 'rather', 'shave', 'essentials', '.', 'found', 'nordstrom', 'ended', 'buying', 'amazon', 'try', '.', 'grown', 'used', 'using', 'shampoo', 'body', 'wash', 'face', 'wash', 'separately', 'thought', 'combination', 'product', 'would', 'speed', 'normal', 'routine', '.', 'thoughtsas', 'shampoo', 'smells', 'great', 'around', 'like', 'herbs', 'cleaner', 'like', 'grocery', 'store', 'brand', '.', 'lathers', 'richly', 'covers', 'easily', 'leaves', 'hair', 'clean', 'workable', 'doesnt', 'strip', 'hair', '.', 'five', 'stars', 'shampoo.as', 'body', 'wash', 'smells', 'great', '.', 'lathers', 'richly', 'generously', 'especially', 'sponge', '.', 'need', 'quarter', 'sized', 'drop', 'hair', 'body', '.', 'leaves', 'skin', 'feeling', 'clean', 'refreshed', 'slightly', 'cool', 'not', 'stripped', 'squeaky', '.', 'five', 'stars', 'body', 'wash.as', 'facial', 'cleanser', 'know', 'smells', 'great', 'lathers', 'well', 'problem', 'left', 'bit', 'residual', 'oil', 'ended', 'sticking', 'normal', 'cleanser', 'kiehls.this', 'great', 'product', 'based', 'usage', 'isnt', 'actually', 'expensive', '.', 'think', 'youd', 'like', 'try', 'start', 'small', 'size', 'work', 'pump', 'bottle', 'lasted', 'eight', 'months', 'far', 'still', 'going', 'strong', '.', 'great', 'product', 'try']"

ive had kp on my arms since 7th grade. it was embarrassing and the dermatologist prescribed everything in the book and none of it worked.my mother gave this to me as a gift. the body wash is nice and gently foams. a little goes a long way on a poof. i usually scrub each area in circles for about 5 seconds. my skin feels really good after the shower.i think the key to results is using this together with the lotion. but if you have very light kp the body wash might work on its own. if you put it on the lotion right after a shower it tingles and burns but thats how you know its working. you can see results in a few weeks and for me the bumps have pretty much gone away. works better than anything a dermatologist recommended,ive kp arms since 7th grade . embarrassing dermatologist prescribed everything book none worked.my mother gave gift . body wash nice gently foams . little goes long way poof . usually scrub area circles 5 seconds . skin feels really good shower.i think key results using together lotion . light kp body wash might work . put lotion right shower tingles burns thats know working . see results weeks bumps pretty much gone away . works better anything dermatologist recommended,"['ive', 'kp', 'arms', 'since', '7th', 'grade', '.', 'embarrassing', 'dermatologist', 'prescribed', 'everything', 'book', 'none', 'worked.my', 'mother', 'gave', 'gift', '.', 'body', 'wash', 'nice', 'gently', 'foams', '.', 'little', 'goes', 'long', 'way', 'poof', '.', 'usually', 'scrub', 'area', 'circles', '5', 'seconds', '.', 'skin', 'feels', 'really', 'good', 'shower.i', 'think', 'key', 'results', 'using', 'together', 'lotion', '.', 'light', 'kp', 'body', 'wash', 'might', 'work', '.', 'put', 'lotion', 'right', 'shower', 'tingles', 'burns', 'thats', 'know', 'working', '.', 'see', 'results', 'weeks', 'bumps', 'pretty', 'much', 'gone', 'away', '.', 'works', 'better', 'anything', 'dermatologist', 'recommended']"
i love this facial cleanser have been using it for a number of years. i have mature skin and it doesnt leave my skin feeling dry afterwards. i do double cleanse since i wear makeup but i find with any cleanser i have to do this. i thought it was discontinued since i couldnt find it at target anymore. i found it on amazon and hoping it was not a fake or expired. it is the real thing. i bought 2 and one of the pumps didnt work. easily returned it and was sent a replacement. it has a really nice soft scent. i dont like any products that are scented especially a strong rose scent but i can barely smell it and if i do i enjoy it. super clean and gentle,love facial cleanser using number years . mature skin doesnt leave skin feeling dry afterwards . double cleanse since wear makeup find cleanser . thought discontinued since couldnt find target anymore . found amazon hoping not fake expired . real thing . bought 2 one pumps didnt work . easily returned sent replacement . really nice soft scent . dont like products scented especially strong rose scent barely smell enjoy . super clean gentle,"['love', 'facial', 'cleanser', 'using', 'number', 'years', '.', 'mature', 'skin', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'skin', 'feeling', 'dry', 'afterwards', '.', 'double', 'cleanse', 'since', 'wear', 'makeup', 'find', 'cleanser', '.', 'thought', 'discontinued', 'since', 'couldnt', 'find', 'target', 'anymore', '.', 'found', 'amazon', 'hoping', 'not', 'fake', 'expired', '.', 'real', 'thing', '.', 'bought', '2', 'one', 'pumps', 'didnt', 'work', '.', 'easily', 'returned', 'sent', 'replacement', '.', 'really', 'nice', 'soft', 'scent', '.', 'dont', 'like', 'products', 'scented', 'especially', 'strong', 'rose', 'scent', 'barely', 'smell', 'enjoy', '.', 'super', 'clean', 'gentle']"

i recently tried the bliss fab foaming 2in1 cleanser and exfoliator with bamboo buffers and i must say it has left a positive impression on my skincare routine. while it falls slightly short in a few areas it deserves a solid fourstar rating for its refreshing formula effective exfoliation and convenience.one of the standout features of this cleanser is its refreshing and invigorating formula. the foaming action creates a luxurious lather that leaves my skin feeling clean fresh and revitalized. the gentle scent adds to the overall sensory experience making it a pleasure to use. i appreciate the clean and refreshed sensation it provides after each use.the inclusion of bamboo buffers in this cleanser adds an exfoliating element to the formula. these natural exfoliants effectively remove dead skin cells and unclog pores leaving my skin smoother and brighter. the gentle exfoliation is suitable for regular use and does not cause any irritation or discomfort. its a convenient way to incorporate exfoliation into my skincare routine without the need for a separate product.the packaging of the bliss fab foaming cleanser is practical and userfriendly. the pump dispenser allows for easy and controlled dispensing preventing waste and ensuring that the product remains fresh and uncontaminated. its a convenient and hygienic option for daily use.while the cleanser performs well in terms of cleansing and exfoliating i find that it may not be the best option for removing heavy makeup or stubborn residue. it is more suitable for daily cleansing or as a secondary cleanse in a double cleansing routine. for those who wear minimal makeup or prefer a gentle cleanser this product is ideal. however if you rely on it solely for makeup removal you may need to use a dedicated makeup remover beforehand.furthermore although the bamboo buffers provide a gentle exfoliation those with very sensitive or reactive skin may find them slightly abrasive. its important to adjust the pressure and frequency of use according to your skins sensitivity level to avoid any potential irritation.in conclusion the bliss fab foaming 2in1 cleanser and exfoliator with bamboo buffers offers a refreshing and dualaction cleansing experience. its foaming formula and bamboo buffers effectively cleanse and exfoliate the skin leaving it feeling clean and revitalized. while it may not be the best option for heavy makeup removal and may not suit extremely sensitive skin it still delivers on its promises. i would give it a solid fourstar rating for its refreshing formula effective exfoliation

a couple years ago i noticed that my arms looked like i had sunburn. like all the time. i mentioned it to my dr and she didnt seem to know what it was. i did some research online and thought it could be keratosis pilaris. i tried different creams and body washes but nothing seemed to work. i happened to see this touch body wash and decided to try it. it took about a week before i saw any results. it got rid of most of the redness and it smells good too the only downside is the price. i mean holy cow 30 for a bottle of body wash there are other products that are similar and are cheaper but now that i know it works im hesitant to switch. so i guess im stuck paying an outrageous amount of money for body wash just to have normal looking arms. at least i wont have anyone pointing out my bad sunburn anymore. tired of people lecturing you on your sunburned arms try this stuff.,couple years ago noticed arms looked like sunburn . like time . mentioned dr didnt seem know . research online thought could keratosis pilaris . tried different creams body washes nothing seemed work . happened see touch body wash decided try . took week saw results . got rid redness smells good downside price . mean holy cow 30 bottle body wash products similar cheaper know works im hesitant switch . guess im stuck paying outrageous amount money body wash normal looking arms . least wont anyone pointing bad sunburn anymore . tired people lecturing sunburned arms try stuff .,"['couple', 'years', 'ago', 'noticed', 'arms', 'looked', 'like', 'sunburn', '.', 'like', 'time', '.', 'mentioned', 'dr', 'didnt', 'seem', 'know', '.', 'research', 'online', 'thought', 'could', 'keratosis', 'pilaris', '.', 'tried', 'different', 'creams', 'body', 'washes', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'work', '.', 'happened', 'see', 'touch', 'body', 'wash', 'decided', 'try', '.', 'took', 'week', 'saw', 'results', '.', 'got', 'rid', 'redness', 'smells', 'good', 'downside', 'price', '.', 'mean', 'holy', 'cow', '30', 'bottle', 'body', 'wash', 'products', 'similar', 'cheaper', 'know', 'works', 'im', 'hesitant', 'switch', '.', 'guess', 'im', 'stuck', 'paying', 'outrageous', 'amount', 'money', 'body', 'wash', 'normal', 'looking', 'arms', '.', 'least', 'wont', 'anyone', 'pointing', 'bad', 'sunburn', 'anymore', '.', 'tired', 'people', 'lecturing', 'sunburned', 'arms', 'try', 'stuff', '.']"

i really like these refill packages of aveeno body wash.  when the amount of shampoo goes down in the bottle i just add as much as i need and am ready to shower again.  they are more economical than purchasing full bottles which use up more plastic which gets wasted.  i keep thinking of all the pollution all these plastic containers cause.  the refill bags do not use as much plastic as the bottles they are easy to refill the original bottles.  they do not take up as much space in my cabinet either. ,really like refill packages aveeno body wash. amount shampoo goes bottle add much need ready shower . economical purchasing full bottles use plastic gets wasted . keep thinking pollution plastic containers cause . refill bags not use much plastic bottles easy refill original bottles . not take much space cabinet either .,"['really', 'like', 'refill', 'packages', 'aveeno', 'body', 'wash.', 'amount', 'shampoo', 'goes', 'bottle', 'add', 'much', 'need', 'ready', 'shower', '.', 'economical', 'purchasing', 'full', 'bottles', 'use', 'plastic', 'gets', 'wasted', '.', 'keep', 'thinking', 'pollution', 'plastic', 'containers', 'cause', '.', 'refill', 'bags', 'not', 'use', 'much', 'plastic', 'bottles', 'easy', 'refill', 'original', 'bottles', '.', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'space', 'cabinet', 'either', '.']"

i would not recommend off label use of this product as my 11 yearold son found out quite by accident. this young lad had very dry skin over the winter so i told him to get the aveno oatmeal lotion bottle from his older brothers room where id seen it earlier and cover his body with it before bed. i described what the bottle looked like the shape the word aveno etc. little did i know his mother had also dropped this bottle of the body wash on his brothers desk for him to shower with and it was right next to the lotion.my poor son found both bottles noticed the body wash matched the description and was larger than the similarly shaped though a narrower bottle. you can guess where this is going. my 11 year olds mind told him bigger is better and proceeded to slather his body from head to toe. with body wash before hopping in bed.i discovered our son later tossing and turning unable to sleep because his dry itchy skin didnt feel better having used the oatmeal lotion.  he said that hed put it on as he was told but that it wouldnt dry no matter how much he rubbed it in. his mother felt his skin and sure enough it was not dry but sticky and slimy.she found that he was covered with the aveno body wash and told him to hop in the shower and rinse it all off immediatelylong story short i understand designing multiple products within your line of branded products so that the bottles have a similar and consistent shape for brand recognition.  however in the case of aveno lotion versus body wash perhaps aveno should consider not making their body wash just look like a thicker bottle of their lotioni know its a bit unfair since the body wash is fine when used as body wash but have deducted one star because of the possibility of product confusion similar to brand confusion between brands with visually similar packaging but instead within one brand between products.when aveno makes their body wash bottles different enough from their familiar lotion bottle it will be updated to 5 stars. how well it works for sensitive skin depends on how you use it,would not recommend label use product 11 yearold son found quite accident . young lad dry skin winter told

after our sixmontholds first time in the pool we gave her a bath with her regular soap  but she still got these little red spots on her body that didnt go away until a couple of days later  and a couple more baths.  the internet said its a chlorine sensitivity and that chlorine binds to your body and keeps reacting even after youre out of the pool.  i contacted triswim to see if this body wash is safe for babies and they said yes it is safe for babies and that they sell to all of the united states swim school association schools.  they recommended testing on a small area first just in case though.  after the second pool experience we washed baby with this body wash  and no red spots.  smells great too.one star off for the packaging though.  the tube needs to be stored upside down we have ours in a cup or you need to transplant the body wash into another container.  the body wash isnt very thick and drips out of the hole in the dispenser leaking into the cap and making a mess.  the hole needs a little valve on it like some shampoo bottles or the body wash needs to be thicker more gellike to prevent this from happening.  from the other reviews it sounds like they know this is an issue and have moved to another kind of cap i received the flip top kind pictured in the item photo but the new cap has issues too. great product terrible packaging,sixmontholds first time pool gave bath regular soap still got little red spots body didnt go away couple days later couple baths . internet said chlorine sensitivity chlorine binds body keeps reacting even youre pool . contacted triswim see body wash safe babies said yes safe babies sell united states swim school association schools . recommended testing small area first case though . second pool experience washed baby body wash no red spots . smells great too.one star packaging though . tube needs stored upside cup need transplant body wash another container . body wash isnt thick drips hole dispenser leaking cap making mess . hole needs little valve like shampoo bottles body wash needs thicker gellike prevent happening . reviews sounds like know issue moved another kind cap received flip top kind pictured item photo new cap issues . great product terrible packaging,"['sixmontholds', 'first', 'time', 'pool', 'gave', 'bath', 'regular', 'soap', 'still', 'got', 'little', 'red', 'spots', 'body', 'didnt', 'go', 'away', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'couple', 'baths', '.', 'internet', 'said', 'chlorine', 'sensitivity', 'chlorine', 'binds', 'body', 'keeps', 'reacting', 'even', 'youre', 'pool', '.', 'contacted', 'triswim', 'see', 'body', 'wash', 'safe', 'babies', 'said', 'yes', 'safe', 'babies', 'sell', 'united', 'states', 'swim', 'school', 'association', 'schools', '.', 'recommended', 'testing', 'small', 'area', 'first', 'case', 'though', '.', 'second', 'pool', 'experience', 'washed', 'baby', 'body', 'wash', 'no', 'red', 'spots', '.', 'smells', 'great', 'too.one', 'star', 'packaging', 'though', '.', 'tube', 'needs', 'stored', 'upside', 'cup', 'need', 'transplant', 'body', 'wash', 'another', 'container', '.', 'body', 'wash', 'isnt', 'thick', 'drips', 'hole', 'dispenser', 'leaking', 'cap', 'making', 'mess', '.', 'hole', 'needs', 'little', 'valve', 'like', 'shampoo', 'bottles', 'body', 'wash', 'needs', 'thicker', 'gellike', 'prevent', 'happening', '.', 'reviews', 'sounds', 'like', 'know', 'issue', 'moved', 'another', 'kind', 'cap', 'received', 'flip', 'top', 'kind', 'pictured', 'item', 'photo', 'new', 'cap', 'issues', '.', 'great', 'product', 'terrible', 'packaging']"

i bought this body wash because i generally love neutrogena and trusted theyd never put anything chemically overly harmful to anyones wellbeing as a brand. but this body wash proved me all the way wrong i bought it with joy and the hype of trying something new after reading the reviews of how heavenly it smells and yes it does smell amazingthe issue lies within the ingredients list. one of the top ingredients is sodium laureth sulfate.what is sodium laureth sulfate or sles for short.sles is a chemical typically used for foaming effects derived from one of the most shunned ingredients in the skincare world. sodium lauryl sulfate or slssles is derived to be less irritating to the skin but comes with an even higher and deadlier risk than irritation cancer.when sles is made from sls it can easily be contaminated with 14dioxane which is a known cancerous agent and a lead to cancer. and even without the risk of cancer you still can gain sensitivity an allergy or overall bad reaction from sles even though its less harsh than sls.dont believe me google it yourself and watch videos about these ingredients and how harmful they can be. sls however is super harsh and has zero to little chance of being contaminated so this company wouldve been better off just tossing sls in as an ingredient and letting people decide if they want a greatsmelling wash with irritated skin but not cancerso.prosit smells great.consirritating to sensitive skincan cause allergic reactionswill strip the skin of its natural oils which can clog pores and cause acnecan cause cancer due to the sodium laureth sulfate if its contaminated.neutrogena please do better with your ingredients. i can understand cutting costs to produce cheap drugstore alternatives for those who dont wanna break the bank. but dont go against the whole journey your company claims to be about and also potentially hand out a side dish of deadly cancer with it. silent but deadly body wash,bought body wash generally love

this is a very good product however with the latest purchase they changed the 32 oz bottle and pump.  first the bottle is now taller and slimmer and i had a hard time initially getting the pump to release so i could use it i needed a plyers to unscrew it for the first use.  then after i inserted the pump into the bottle i needed to pump it like 100 times in order to get the body wash to come out.  now that the body wash is finally coming out its not dispensing as much as the previous bottle  pump.and once you do the initial press nothing else comes out.and you need to wait like 30 seconds for more to press the pump again to get more body wash. evidently they appear to be using a new supplier or implemented a new design and i am not happy.  its a shame because its a good product but the bottle and pump is very poor quality.  i expect more when i am paying 50 for this. i dont leave very many one star reviews but people need to know my experience here. ,good product however latest purchase changed 32 oz bottle pump . first bottle taller slimmer hard time initially getting pump release could use needed plyers unscrew first use . inserted pump bottle needed pump like 100 times order get body wash come . body wash finally coming not dispensing much previous bottle pump.and initial press nothing else comes out.and need wait like 30 seconds press pump get body wash. evidently appear using new supplier implemented new design not happy . shame good product bottle pump poor quality . expect paying 50 . dont leave many one star reviews people need know experience .,"['good', 'product', 'however', 'latest', 'purchase', 'changed', '32', 'oz', 'bottle', 'pump', '.', 'first', 'bottle', 'taller', 'slimmer', 'hard', 'time', 'initially', 'getting', 'pump', 'release', 'could', 'use', 'needed', 'plyers', 'unscrew', 'first', 'use', '.', 'inserted', 'pump', 'bottle', 'needed', 'pump', 'like', '100', 'times', 'order', 'get', 'body', 'wash', 'come', '.', 'body', 'wash', 'finally', 'coming', 'not', 'dispensing', 'much', 'previous', 'bottle', 'pump.and', 'initial', 'press', 'nothing', 'else', 'comes', 'out.and', 'need', 'wait', 'like', '30', 'seconds', 'press', 'pump', 'get', 'body', 'wash.', 'evidently', 'appear', 'using', 'new', 'supplier', 'implemented', 'new', 'design', 'not', 'happy', '.', 'shame', 'good', 'product', 'bottle', 'pump', 'poor', 'quality', '.', 'expect', 'paying', '50', '.', 'dont', 'leave', 'many', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'people', 'need', 'know', 'experience', '.']"
i am more than pleased with this triswim body wash. im not a swimming kind of person so its been a whole lot of years since i spent any time in a pool. realizing that aqua therapy would be really helpful to my osteoarthritic knees i tossed all my omg i cant wear a bathing suit in public anxieties ok maybe tossed is a strong word  tried to ignore those anxieties and jumped right in. i thought i had everything covered  bathing suit.check swim shoes and flip flops.check check absorbent towel.i even remembered to pack plastic bags to hold the wet stuff. what i didnt realize is how much my skin has changed since i was a kid. gone are the days of normal skin  enter old lady dry skin that gets even drier after exposed to chlorine. i was in agony id shower after my therapy  use my usual body wash and id still smell like chlorine for several hours. by later in the evening every bit of my body was itching like crazy.to the point i was even waking up the unwakeable cat. i tried the triswim body wash for the first time this week and was thrilled that i could go back to work without smelling of chlorine and hardly an itch to be had afterwards. i did purchase the lotion as well and havent tried that yet since the body wash is working for the itch but i like knowing its there if i need it. i am sensitive to smells and the scent of this body wash  to me is a light clean slightly floralcitrusy scent that disappears pretty quick. ive had coworkers whiff me after therapy sessions and they cant smell the chlorine.so between no whiff and no itch im a happy girl no more itch or whiff,pleased triswim body wash. im not swimming kind person whole lot years since spent time pool . realizing aqua therapy would really helpful osteoarthritic knees tossed omg cant wear bathing suit public anxieties ok maybe tossed strong word tried ignore anxieties jumped right . thought everything covered bathing suit.check swim shoes flip flops.check check absorbent towel.i even remembered pack plastic bags hold wet stuff . didnt realize much skin changed since kid . gone days normal skin enter old lady dry skin gets even drier exposed chlorine . agony id shower therapy use usual body wash id still smell like chlorine several hours . later evening every bit body itching like crazy.to point even waking unwakeable cat . tried triswim body wash first time week thrilled could go back work without smelling chlorine hardly itch afterwards . purchase lotion well havent tried yet since body wash working itch like knowing need . sensitive smells scent body wash light clean slightly floralcitrusy scent disappears pretty quick . ive coworkers whiff therapy sessions cant smell chlorine.so no whiff no itch im happy girl no itch whiff,"['pleased', 'triswim', 'body', 'wash.', 'im', 'not', 'swimming', 'kind', 'person', 'whole', 'lot', 'years', 'since', 'spent', 'time', 'pool', '.', 'realizing', 'aqua', 'therapy', 'would', 'really', 'helpful', 'osteoarthritic', 'knees', 'tossed', 'omg', 'cant', 'wear', 'bathing', 'suit', 'public', 'anxieties', 'ok', 'maybe', 'tossed', 'strong', 'word', 'tried', 'ignore', 'anxieties', 'jumped', 'right', '.', 'thought', 'everything', 'covered', 'bathing', 'suit.check', 'swim', 'shoes', 'flip', 'flops.check', 'check', 'absorbent', 'towel.i', 'even', 'remembered', 'pack', 'plastic', 'bags', 'hold', 'wet', 'stuff', '.', 'didnt', 'realize', 'much', 'skin', 'changed', 'since', 'kid', '.', 'gone', 'days', 'normal', 'skin', 'enter', 'old', 'lady', 'dry', 'skin', 'gets', 'even', 'drier', 'exposed', 'chlorine', '.', 'agony', 'id', 'shower', 'therapy', 'use', 'usual', 'body', 'wash', 'id', 'still', 'smell', 'like', 'chlorine', 'several', 'hours', '.', 'later', 'evening', 'every', 'bit', 'body', 'itching', 'like', 'crazy.to', 'point', 'even', 'waking', 'unwakeable', 'cat', '.', 'tried', 'triswim', 'body', 'wash', 'first', 'time', 'week', 'thrilled', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'without', 'smelling', 'chlorine', 'hardly', 'itch', 'afterwards', '.', 'purchase', 'lotion', 'well', 'havent', 'tried', 'yet', 'since', 'body', 'wash', 'working', 'itch', 'like', 'knowing', 'need', '.', 'sensitive', 'smells', 'scent', 'body', 'wash', 'light', 'clean', 'slightly', 'floralcitrusy', 'scent', 'disappears', 'pretty', 'quick', '.', 'ive', 'coworkers', 'whiff', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'cant', 'smell', 'chlorine.so', 'no', 'whiff', 'no', 'itch', 'im', 'happy', 'girl', 'no', 'itch', 'whiff']"

i have been using this for over a year now but i have not reviewed it yet since i first wanted to make sure that it actually works. i had terrible eczema last winter for the first time ever which led me to spend megabucks to swim in a club with a saltwater pool. the club was neither near my home nor my work location so it was a terrible inconvenience as well as 5x the price of my local clubs that had chlorine pools.i made the decision to quit the saltwater pool and go back to my local clubs and then really start using triswim religiously. the worst of my eczema last winter was on my forearms and hands and calves and feet and i had to use quite a bit of strong topical steroid to combat it. this year i have only used triswim on my forearms and hands and triswim plus ceracade on my calves and feet and i have had zero eczema in either area at all this winter up to this date 18 feb 2019. remember triswim only on my hands and forearms were the only change between this year and last year.i also started to experience itchiness at the area where my neck meets my shoulders for some reason and it was starting to be a thing if you will. i thought it might be chlorine since i only swim crawl and im pushing a lot of pool water in that area. since then ive been using triswim on that area the past few weeks and the itching has gone away.i think i can say with confidence that triswim works extremely well. the change of using triswim alone on the problems of my hands forearms and neckshoulder area is the best evidence while triswim plus ceracade have done the job for my calves and feet. in the future i might eliminate ceracade from my calves and feet and see triswim solves the problem well enough on its own. ,using year not reviewed yet since first wanted make sure actually works . terrible eczema last winter first time ever led spend megabucks swim club saltwater pool . club neither near home nor work location terrible inconvenience well 5x price local clubs chlorine pools.i made decision quit saltwater pool go back local clubs really start using triswim religiously . worst eczema last winter forearms hands calves feet use quite bit strong topical steroid combat . year used triswim forearms hands triswim plus ceracade calves feet zero eczema either area winter date 18 feb 2019. remember triswim hands forearms change year last year.i also started experience itchiness area neck meets shoulders reason starting thing . thought might chlorine since swim crawl im pushing lot pool water area . since ive using triswim area past weeks itching gone away.i think say confidence triswim works extremely well . change using triswim alone problems hands forearms neckshoulder area best evidence triswim plus ceracade done job calves feet . future might eliminate ceracade calves feet see triswim solves problem well enough .,"['using', 'year', 'not', 'reviewed', 'yet', 'since', 'first', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'actually', 'works', '.', 'terrible', 'eczema', 'last', 'winter', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'led', 'spend', 'megabucks', 'swim', 'club', 'saltwater', 'pool', '.', 'club', 'neither', 'near', 'home', 'nor', 'work', 'location', 'terrible', 'inconvenience', 'well', '5x', 'price', 'local', 'clubs', 'chlorine', 'pools.i', 'made', 'decision', 'quit', 'saltwater', 'pool', 'go', 'back', 'local', 'clubs', 'really', 'start', 'using', 'triswim', 'religiously', '.', 'worst', 'eczema', 'last', 'winter', 'forearms', 'hands', 'calves', 'feet', 'use', 'quite', 'bit', 'strong', 'topical', 'steroid', 'combat', '.', 'year', 'used', 'triswim', 'forearms', 'hands', 'triswim', 'plus', 'ceracade', 'calves', 'feet', 'zero', 'eczema', 'either', 'area', 'winter', 'date', '18', 'feb', '2019.', 'remember', 'triswim', 'hands', 'forearms', 'change', 'year', 'last', 'year.i', 'also', 'started', 'experience', 'itchiness', 'area', 'neck', 'meets', 'shoulders', 'reason', 'starting', 'thing', '.', 'thought', 'might', 'chlorine', 'since', 'swim', 'crawl', 'im', 'pushing', 'lot', 'pool', 'water', 'area', '.', 'since', 'ive', 'using', 'triswim', 'area', 'past', 'weeks', 'itching', 'gone', 'away.i', 'think', 'say', 'confidence', 'triswim', 'works', 'extremely', 'well', '.', 'change', 'using', 'triswim', 'alone', 'problems', 'hands', 'forearms', 'neckshoulder', 'area', 'best', 'evidence', 'triswim', 'plus', 'ceracade', 'done', 'job', 'calves', 'feet', '.', 'future', 'might', 'eliminate', 'ceracade', 'calves', 'feet', 'see', 'triswim', 'solves', 'problem', 'well', 'enough', '.']"

ive been using the bliss fabulous foaming face wash everyday in the shower for close to 10 years. it is perfect and i never thought for a second i might have to learn to live with something new. the last time i tried to order it in  may 2019 i realized the packaging looked a bit different the older version was selling on amazon by secondary retailers for way too much money and i hoped the wash itself was still the same. it is a bit different  the scent of the old one was much better  more exciting and i liked the former texture better. however it still cleans the way it always did and feels great  it seems as though they made the switch in an environmentfriendly move to get rid of microbeads so i can support this change. miss the old version but this is good,ive using bliss fabulous foaming face wash everyday shower close 10 years . perfect never thought second might learn live something new . last time tried order may 2019 realized packaging looked bit different older version selling amazon secondary retailers way much money hoped wash still . bit different scent old one much better exciting liked former texture better . however still cleans way always feels great seems though made switch environmentfriendly move get rid microbeads support change . miss old version good,"['ive', 'using', 'bliss', 'fabulous', 'foaming', 'face', 'wash', 'everyday', 'shower', 'close', '10', 'years', '.', 'perfect', 'never', 'thought', 'second', 'might', 'learn', 'live', 'something', 'new', '.', 'last', 'time', 'tried', 'order', 'may', '2019', 'realized', 'packaging', 'looked', 'bit', 'different', 'older', 'version', 'selling', 'amazon', 'secondary', 'retailers', 'way', 'much', 'money', 'hoped', 'wash', 'still', '.', 'bit', 'different', 'scent', 'old', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'exciting', 'liked', 'former', 'texture', 'better', '.', 'however', 'still', 'cleans', 'way', 'always', 'feels', 'great', 'seems', 'though', 'made', 'switch', 'environmentfriendly', 'move', 'get', 'rid', 'microbeads', 'support', 'change', '.', 'miss', 'old', 'version', 'good']"

ive used bliss fabulous foaming before from a hotel and loved it. the issue i had was with the microplastic beads a sort of ecomoral dilemma. after a couple years of this listing being saved in my wish list and after some failed attempts with other products i revisited and purchased this one. come to find out it is a different productthe original product is called bliss fabulous foaming which has been discontinued which can still be found on amazon for very high prices. this new product the current one is called bliss fab foaming.the big difference is that the micro beads have been replaced by bamboo buffers. i dont know what bamboo buffers are but i know what they are not. they are not micro bead replacements. micro beads have a great texture and gently scrubs skin. the bamboo buffer has nearzero texture perhaps as if you removed 99 of the beads and flattened the remaining ones. its basically like a regular face wash without beads.this is as of late 2018 at least. youd be prudent to mentally compensate for all reviews prior to that as they were for the old product.that said they have retained the same smell. its a very pleasant floral scent that i love. functionally it works about as well as other nonmicro bead facial cleansers. but this new formulation while better for the environment is no where near the performance of their older product. they should not have reused the same listing and reviews. warning this is a new bliss product reusing an older listing.,ive used bliss fabulous foaming hotel loved . issue microplastic beads sort ecomoral dilemma . couple years listing saved wish list failed attempts products revisited purchased one . come find different productthe original product called bliss fabulous foaming discontinued still found amazon high prices . new product current one called bliss fab foaming.the big difference micro beads replaced bamboo buffers . dont know bamboo buffers know not . not micro bead replacements . micro beads great texture gently scrubs skin . bamboo buffer nearzero texture perhaps removed 99 beads flattened remaining ones . basically like regular face wash without beads.this late 2018 least . youd prudent mentally compensate reviews prior old product.that said retained smell . pleasant floral scent love . functionally works well nonmicro bead facial cleansers . new formulation better environment no near performance older product . not reused listing reviews . warning new bliss product reusing older listing .,"['ive', 'used', 'bliss', 'fabulous', 'foaming', 'hotel', 'loved', '.', 'issue', 'microplastic', 'beads', 'sort', 'ecomoral', 'dilemma', '.', 'couple', 'years', 'listing', 'saved', 'wish', 'list', 'failed', 'attempts', 'products', 'revisited', 'purchased', 'one', '.', 'come', 'find', 'different', 'productthe', 'original', 'product', 'called', 'bliss', 'fabulous', 'foaming', 'discontinued', 'still', 'found', 'amazon', 'high', 'prices', '.', 'new', 'product', 'current', 'one', 'called', 'bliss', 'fab', 'foaming.the', 'big', 'difference', 'micro', 'beads', 'replaced', 'bamboo', 'buffers', '.', 'dont', 'know', 'bamboo', 'buffers', 'know', 'not', '.', 'not', 'micro', 'bead', 'replacements', '.', 'micro', 'beads', 'great', 'texture', 'gently', 'scrubs', 'skin', '.', 'bamboo', 'buffer', 'nearzero', 'texture', 'perhaps', 'removed', '99', 'beads', 'flattened', 'remaining', 'ones', '.', 'basically', 'like', 'regular', 'face', 'wash', 'without', 'beads.this', 'late', '2018', 'least', '.', 'youd', 'prudent', 'mentally', 'compensate', 'reviews', 'prior', 'old', 'product.that', 'said', 'retained', 'smell', '.', 'pleasant', 'floral', 'scent', 'love', '.', 'functionally', 'works', 'well', 'nonmicro', 'bead', 'facial', 'cleansers', '.', 'new', 'formulation', 'better', 'environment', 'no', 'near', 'performance', 'older', 'product', '.', 'not', 'reused', 'listing', 'reviews', '.', 'warning', 'new', 'bliss', 'product', 'reusing', 'older', 'listing', '.']"

i rarely ever write reviews but after using brickell products for over a year now im hooked and i need to let it be known. a little over a year ago i was searching for a no nonsense simple ingredient shampoo and stumbled upon brickell. they offered a sample pack of sorts so i tried it out. immediately i knew these folks are legit. every container in my shower now has their logo on it. ive never been one to do much with routines and such just not that kind of guy. but their scrubs and serums are actually life changing haha. my girlfriend even has a jar of their body scrub in her shower again it feels somewhat weird raving about soap so much but i guess you just have to feel it to believe it. my skin is no longer dry and flaky as it has been in the past using dr. bronners and others that just make a bunch of sulfatey suds. the difference is remarkable. simple is just better. period. i particularly love traveling with the 3in1 soap as i can hit face hair and body super quick in one bottle. these products are truly superior. and for what its worth im not some metro dude no offense intended. im from the country basically a redneck hippy. simple soaps for simple men. stop stripping your skin and hair of their nutrients and buy this soap. you will not be disappointed. and sign up for their emails they have killer deals all the time. ok thats all for now. peace ,rarely ever write reviews using brickell products year im hooked need let known . little year ago searching no nonsense simple ingredient shampoo stumbled upon brickell . offered sample pack sorts tried . immediately knew folks legit . every container shower logo . ive never one much routines not kind guy . scrubs serums actually life changing haha . girlfriend even jar body scrub shower feels somewhat weird raving soap much guess feel believe . skin no longer dry flaky past using dr. bronners others make bunch sulfatey suds . difference remarkable . simple better . period . particularly love traveling 3in1 soap hit face hair body super quick one bottle . products truly superior . worth im not metro dude no offense intended . im country basically redneck hippy . simple soaps simple men . stop stripping skin hair nutrients buy soap . not disappointed . sign emails killer deals time . ok thats . peace,"['rarely', 'ever', 'write', 'reviews', 'using', 'brickell', 'products', 'year', 'im', 'hooked', 'need', 'let', 'known', '.', 'little', 'year', 'ago', 'searching', 'no', 'nonsense', 'simple', 'ingredient', 'shampoo', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'brickell', '.', 'offered', 'sample', 'pack', 'sorts', 'tried', '.', 'immediately', 'knew', 'folks', 'legit', '.', 'every', 'container', 'shower', 'logo', '.', 'ive', 'never', 'one', 'much', 'routines', 'not', 'kind', 'guy', '.', 'scrubs', 'serums', 'actually', 'life', 'changing', 'haha', '.', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'jar', 'body', 'scrub', 'shower', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'weird', 'raving', 'soap', 'much', 'guess', 'feel', 'believe', '.', 'skin', 'no', 'longer', 'dry', 'flaky', 'past', 'using', 'dr.', 'bronners', 'others', 'make', 'bunch', 'sulfatey', 'suds', '.', 'difference', 'remarkable', '.', 'simple', 'better', '.', 'period', '.', 'particularly', 'love', 'traveling', '3in1', 'soap', 'hit', 'face', 'hair', 'body', 'super', 'quick', 'one', 'bottle', '.', 'products', 'truly', 'superior', '.', 'worth', 'im', 'not', 'metro', 'dude', 'no', 'offense', 'intended', '.', 'im', 'country', 'basically', 'redneck', 'hippy', '.', 'simple', 'soaps', 'simple', 'men', '.', 'stop', 'stripping', 'skin', 'hair', 'nutrients', 'buy', 'soap', '.', 'not', 'disappointed', '.', 'sign', 'emails', 'killer', 'deals', 'time', '.', 'ok', 'thats', '.', 'peace']"
this is an excellent body wash that leaves my skin clean moisturized and smelling great. the minty zing is noticeable but subtle an excellent complement to the cleansing lather. it comes in a good size container so its a great value for the cost and using a wash cloth over a loofah i tend to use 23 quartersize applications per wash. i prefer this hands down over the bar soap i was using before this  highly recommend awesome body wash with great scent,excellent body wash leaves skin clean moisturized smelling great . minty zing noticeable subtle excellent complement cleansing lather . comes good size container great value cost using wash cloth loofah tend use 23 quartersize applications per wash. prefer hands bar soap using highly recommend awesome body wash great scent,"['excellent', 'body', 'wash', 'leaves', 'skin', 'clean', 'moisturized', 'smelling', 'great', '.', 'minty', 'zing', 'noticeable', 'subtle', 'excellent', 'complement', 'cleansing', 'lather', '.', 'comes', 'good', 'size', 'container', 'great', 'value', 'cost', 'using', 'wash', 'cloth', 'loofah', 'tend', 'use', '23', 'quartersize', 'applications', 'per', 'wash.', 'prefer', 'hands', 'bar', 'soap', 'using', 'highly', 'recommend', 'awesome', 'body', 'wash', 'great', 'scent']"

im not sure if its a new formula or an expiration issue but the last two times ive ordered refills of this body wash it develops a weird sourmilk smell after about two weeks. it doesnt seem to matter if i make sure the bottle its going into is clean before refilling it. after a while it just starts to stink.it still moisturizes and cleans well. and it rinses fairly cleanly. but the smell is a deal breaker even if it doesnt usually linger on my skin.i think im going to have to find another brand. ,im not sure new formula expiration issue last two times ive ordered refills body wash develops weird sourmilk smell two weeks . doesnt seem matter make sure bottle going clean refilling . starts stink.it still moisturizes cleans well . rinses fairly cleanly . smell deal breaker even doesnt usually linger skin.i think im going find another brand .,"['im', 'not', 'sure', 'new', 'formula', 'expiration', 'issue', 'last', 'two', 'times', 'ive', 'ordered', 'refills', 'body', 'wash', 'develops', 'weird', 'sourmilk', 'smell', 'two', 'weeks', '.', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'matter', 'make', 'sure', 'bottle', 'going', 'clean', 'refilling', '.', 'starts', 'stink.it', 'still', 'moisturizes', 'cleans', 'well', '.', 'rinses', 'fairly', 'cleanly', '.', 'smell', 'deal', 'breaker', 'even', 'doesnt', 'usually', 'linger', 'skin.i', 'think', 'im', 'going', 'find', 'another', 'brand', '.']"

firstly the pump was taped down when it arrived which would be fine because it prevents leaking and all that but it actually made it so once i did lift up the pump tons of the face wash spilled out. also the pump flat out does not work. so i have to unscrew the pump and get some off of the tube inside to use it. the actual product is okay it is extremely thick which is usually good but in this case is a bit too thick and is hard to wash off. it cleanses my skin well but then leaves it super dry and thirsty so i have to be sure to apply moisturizer right away afterwards. idk its just meh. i thought i could save some money buying a cheap face wash since i spend so much on different serums and moisturizers and such but this kind of proved to me that you get what you pay for unfortunately. ,firstly pump taped arrived would fine prevents leaking actually made lift pump tons face wash spilled . also pump flat not work . unscrew pump get tube inside use . actual product okay extremely thick usually good case bit thick hard wash . cleanses skin well leaves super dry thirsty sure apply moisturizer right away afterwards . idk meh . thought could save money buying cheap face wash since spend much different serums moisturizers kind proved get pay unfortunately .,"['firstly', 'pump', 'taped', 'arrived', 'would', 'fine', 'prevents', 'leaking', 'actually', 'made', 'lift', 'pump', 'tons', 'face', 'wash', 'spilled', '.', 'also', 'pump', 'flat', 'not', 'work', '.', 'unscrew', 'pump', 'get', 'tube', 'inside', 'use', '.', 'actual', 'product', 'okay', 'extremely', 'thick', 'usually', 'good', 'case', 'bit', 'thick', 'hard', 'wash', '.', 'cleanses', 'skin', 'well', 'leaves', 'super', 'dry', 'thirsty', 'sure', 'apply', 'moisturizer', 'right', 'away', 'afterwards', '.', 'idk', 'meh', '.', 'thought', 'could', 'save', 'money', 'buying', 'cheap', 'face', 'wash', 'since', 'spend', 'much', 'different', 'serums', 'moisturizers', 'kind', 'proved', 'get', 'pay', 'unfortunately', '.']"
