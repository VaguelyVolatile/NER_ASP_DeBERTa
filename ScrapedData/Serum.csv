i buy this product all the time. the last bottle was opened the product is discolored and the dropper was already in the product instead of having to do it yourself. im confused.  this was my 19th time ordering.  what happened is there a change in product or is it fake it smells different too. ,buy product time . last bottle opened product discolored dropper already product instead . im confused . 19th time ordering . happened change product fake smells different .,"['buy', 'product', 'time', '.', 'last', 'bottle', 'opened', 'product', 'discolored', 'dropper', 'already', 'product', 'instead', '.', 'im', 'confused', '.', '19th', 'time', 'ordering', '.', 'happened', 'change', 'product', 'fake', 'smells', 'different', '.']"

this product had all the good beauty buzzwords its just packaged in a terrible dispenser. keeping the three ingredients separated must be a thing but the style of the bottle and pump make it tough to dispense. the box and the bottle are obviously real lancome but i was shocked there was no instruction flyer inside which makes it seem like a rushed distribution. the product certainly smells like lancome and i wish they would go easy on the fragrance. and the bottle is so large and cumbersome but it felt empty even fresh out of the box. it took me three or four pumps to get all three products to come out and its impossible to tell if its almost empty which is annoying for knowing when to replace the bottle.as for effectiveness i have to say this is the worst part about my experience. i thought this was an allover serum but now i wonder if it is an eye serum. ive been using it on my dcolletage and neck and it feels nice going on though a bit sticky and tacky at first. it does settle in fine and ive had no redness or irritation from it. but there has been no earthshattering visible results and it takes a bit to absorb completely. i wouldnt say its worthless but the price is a bit high and im not seeing a big difference after using it for a few weeks. if youre not using a serum this one seems gentle enough to start with and it layers under moisturizer just fine. for my use on my neck i dont find a lot of glow or skin brightness happening but its not hurting either so it might be great for someone else. i am going to switch to using it as an eye serum and see if it helps with other issues like fine lines. for your neck or dcolletage its just ok and youll want to add more moisture for mature skin. terrible pump design not clear what its for,product good beauty buzzwords packaged terrible dispenser . keeping three ingredients separated must thing style bottle pump make tough dispense . box bottle obviously real lancome shocked no instruction flyer inside makes seem like rushed distribution . product certainly smells like lancome wish would go easy fragrance . bottle large cumbersome felt empty even fresh box . took three four pumps get three products come impossible tell almost empty annoying knowing replace bottle.as effectiveness say worst part experience . thought allover serum wonder eye serum . ive using dcolletage neck feels nice going though bit sticky tacky first . settle fine ive no redness irritation . no earthshattering visible results takes bit absorb completely . wouldnt say worthless price bit high im not seeing big difference using weeks . youre not using serum one seems gentle enough start layers moisturizer fine . use neck dont find lot glow skin brightness happening not hurting either might great someone else . going switch using eye serum see helps issues like fine lines . neck dcolletage ok youll want add moisture mature skin . terrible pump design not clear,"['product', 'good', 'beauty', 'buzzwords', 'packaged', 'terrible', 'dispenser', '.', 'keeping', 'three', 'ingredients', 'separated', 'must', 'thing', 'style', 'bottle', 'pump', 'make', 'tough', 'dispense', '.', 'box', 'bottle', 'obviously', 'real', 'lancome', 'shocked', 'no', 'instruction', 'flyer', 'inside', 'makes', 'seem', 'like', 'rushed', 'distribution', '.', 'product', 'certainly', 'smells', 'like', 'lancome', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'easy', 'fragrance', '.', 'bottle', 'large', 'cumbersome', 'felt', 'empty', 'even', 'fresh', 'box', '.', 'took', 'three', 'four', 'pumps', 'get', 'three', 'products', 'come', 'impossible', 'tell', 'almost', 'empty', 'annoying', 'knowing', 'replace', 'bottle.as', 'effectiveness', 'say', 'worst', 'part', 'experience', '.', 'thought', 'allover', 'serum', 'wonder', 'eye', 'serum', '.', 'ive', 'using', 'dcolletage', 'neck', 'feels', 'nice', 'going', 'though', 'bit', 'sticky', 'tacky', 'first', '.', 'settle', 'fine', 'ive', 'no', 'redness', 'irritation', '.', 'no', 'earthshattering', 'visible', 'results', 'takes', 'bit', 'absorb', 'completely', '.', 'wouldnt', 'say', 'worthless', 'price', 'bit', 'high', 'im', 'not', 'seeing', 'big', 'difference', 'using', 'weeks', '.', 'youre', 'not', 'using', 'serum', 'one', 'seems', 'gentle', 'enough', 'start', 'layers', 'moisturizer', 'fine', '.', 'use', 'neck', 'dont', 'find', 'lot', 'glow', 'skin', 'brightness', 'happening', 'not', 'hurting', 'either', 'might', 'great', 'someone', 'else', '.', 'going', 'switch', 'using', 'eye', 'serum', 'see', 'helps', 'issues', 'like', 'fine', 'lines', '.', 'neck', 'dcolletage', 'ok', 'youll', 'want', 'add', 'moisture', 'mature', 'skin', '.', 'terrible', 'pump', 'design', 'not', 'clear']"

this serum is a game changer for me and i feel like i have to share my secret with my lovely readers. ive always battled with fine lines and wrinkles and although not a fan of the jar this was such a game changer when applied twice daily for two weeks. it now has a certain glow and texture that makes it appear to be much healthier and considerably younger. the hyaluronic acid helps to lock moisture into the skin while the retinol of the nighttime formula assists in the skin tone to become brighter. it really does go a long way and it actually blends well with makeup without causing it to pill. i also like that its not oily and doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky it dries very fast. by todays standard of food costs this is fantastic value for money especially as the ingredients are of such high quality. i will surely buy it again when i finish using it or when it gets finished from my side i would order it again. ,serum game changer feel like share secret lovely readers . ive always battled fine lines wrinkles although not fan jar game changer applied twice daily two weeks . certain glow texture makes appear much healthier considerably younger . hyaluronic acid helps lock moisture skin retinol nighttime formula assists skin tone become brighter . really go long way actually blends well makeup without causing pill . also like not oily doesnt leave skin feeling greasy sticky dries fast . todays standard food costs fantastic value money especially ingredients high quality . surely buy finish using gets finished side would order .,"['serum', 'game', 'changer', 'feel', 'like', 'share', 'secret', 'lovely', 'readers', '.', 'ive', 'always', 'battled', 'fine', 'lines', 'wrinkles', 'although', 'not', 'fan', 'jar', 'game', 'changer', 'applied', 'twice', 'daily', 'two', 'weeks', '.', 'certain', 'glow', 'texture', 'makes', 'appear', 'much', 'healthier', 'considerably', 'younger', '.', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'helps', 'lock', 'moisture', 'skin', 'retinol', 'nighttime', 'formula', 'assists', 'skin', 'tone', 'become', 'brighter', '.', 'really', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'actually', 'blends', 'well', 'makeup', 'without', 'causing', 'pill', '.', 'also', 'like', 'not', 'oily', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'skin', 'feeling', 'greasy', 'sticky', 'dries', 'fast', '.', 'todays', 'standard', 'food', 'costs', 'fantastic', 'value', 'money', 'especially', 'ingredients', 'high', 'quality', '.', 'surely', 'buy', 'finish', 'using', 'gets', 'finished', 'side', 'would', 'order', '.']"

i have used several excellent lancome products over the years but i am not pleased with this one.  the serum comes in an impressive expensive looking bottle with a unique pump.  the serum rolled down the bottle rather than coming straight out so holding the bottle sideways is preferred. it feels a bit sticky after application but it does make an immediate difference in the smoothness of skin.  th scent is minimal so it doesnt irritate my eyes.  unfortunately it receives a very poor rating from natural skin care apps due to the addition of octocrylene which might disrupt reproduction and is poor for aquatic life. ,used several excellent lancome products years not pleased one . serum comes impressive expensive looking bottle unique pump . serum rolled bottle rather coming straight holding bottle sideways preferred . feels bit sticky application make immediate difference smoothness skin . th scent minimal doesnt irritate eyes . unfortunately receives poor rating natural skin care apps due addition octocrylene might disrupt reproduction poor aquatic life .,"['used', 'several', 'excellent', 'lancome', 'products', 'years', 'not', 'pleased', 'one', '.', 'serum', 'comes', 'impressive', 'expensive', 'looking', 'bottle', 'unique', 'pump', '.', 'serum', 'rolled', 'bottle', 'rather', 'coming', 'straight', 'holding', 'bottle', 'sideways', 'preferred', '.', 'feels', 'bit', 'sticky', 'application', 'make', 'immediate', 'difference', 'smoothness', 'skin', '.', 'th', 'scent', 'minimal', 'doesnt', 'irritate', 'eyes', '.', 'unfortunately', 'receives', 'poor', 'rating', 'natural', 'skin', 'care', 'apps', 'due', 'addition', 'octocrylene', 'might', 'disrupt', 'reproduction', 'poor', 'aquatic', 'life', '.']"

this is a really interesting concept  when you dispense the product by pumping it there are 3 different serums that you mix in your hand. i like this because you know that youre getting products that are meant to target different things. this type of packaging also helps preserve the product longer versus a container that you open and expose the product to air over and over.i do find that my skin is plumper after only having used this for about a week and im expecting that it will take longer to see a visible difference in lines and dark spots. the scent isnt my favorite but its not awful. this is my first time using lancome so im excited to see how it works in a month i do feel like 75 is high for a bottle this size but if it works itll be priceless. so far so good,really interesting concept dispense product pumping 3 different serums mix hand . like know youre getting products meant target different things . type packaging also helps preserve product longer versus container open expose product air over.i find skin plumper used week im expecting take longer see visible difference lines dark spots . scent isnt favorite not awful . first time using lancome im excited see works month feel like 75 high bottle size works itll priceless . far good,"['really', 'interesting', 'concept', 'dispense', 'product', 'pumping', '3', 'different', 'serums', 'mix', 'hand', '.', 'like', 'know', 'youre', 'getting', 'products', 'meant', 'target', 'different', 'things', '.', 'type', 'packaging', 'also', 'helps', 'preserve', 'product', 'longer', 'versus', 'container', 'open', 'expose', 'product', 'air', 'over.i', 'find', 'skin', 'plumper', 'used', 'week', 'im', 'expecting', 'take', 'longer', 'see', 'visible', 'difference', 'lines', 'dark', 'spots', '.', 'scent', 'isnt', 'favorite', 'not', 'awful', '.', 'first', 'time', 'using', 'lancome', 'im', 'excited', 'see', 'works', 'month', 'feel', 'like', '75', 'high', 'bottle', 'size', 'works', 'itll', 'priceless', '.', 'far', 'good']"

this is is an interestingly designed bottle but its set so all of the ingredients are stored separately inside and activate simultaneously when you pump. out comes the hyaluronic acid niacinamide and ferulic acid and they mix into a milky serum. it does have a slight floral scent and its reminiscent of some other skincare ive used in the past but in no way is it overpowering. it lightly goes on absorbs quickly and feels super hydrating. i quite like the satin feel it leaves behind on my naturally oily skin as its not oily sticky or tacky one bit. unique design with hydrating ingredients but less product than it seems.,interestingly designed bottle set ingredients stored separately inside activate simultaneously pump . comes hyaluronic acid niacinamide ferulic acid mix milky serum . slight floral scent reminiscent skincare ive used past no way overpowering . lightly goes absorbs quickly feels super hydrating . quite like satin feel leaves behind naturally oily skin not oily sticky tacky one bit . unique design hydrating ingredients less product seems .,"['interestingly', 'designed', 'bottle', 'set', 'ingredients', 'stored', 'separately', 'inside', 'activate', 'simultaneously', 'pump', '.', 'comes', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'niacinamide', 'ferulic', 'acid', 'mix', 'milky', 'serum', '.', 'slight', 'floral', 'scent', 'reminiscent', 'skincare', 'ive', 'used', 'past', 'no', 'way', 'overpowering', '.', 'lightly', 'goes', 'absorbs', 'quickly', 'feels', 'super', 'hydrating', '.', 'quite', 'like', 'satin', 'feel', 'leaves', 'behind', 'naturally', 'oily', 'skin', 'not', 'oily', 'sticky', 'tacky', 'one', 'bit', '.', 'unique', 'design', 'hydrating', 'ingredients', 'less', 'product', 'seems', '.']"
triple serumnot a fan of this serum. i love and have tried all kinds of facial serums over my 73 years. i have used several other lancme products over the past years. at present i use one of their sunscreens and love it but this triple serum is not for my face for at least a couple of reasons. when i apply this it goes on feeling very sticky. 15 minutes later it will be less sticky feeling but still have a tacky feeling when i touch my face. about 710 minutes after applying my face will start burning. i do have some sensitive areas on my face such as along my upper cheeks. this serum burns there as well as on my upper lip area no i hadnt just waxed that area and the area under my chin also burned which i had never had a problem there or above my lips so something in this doesnt agree with my skin. the burning lasts at least 20 minutes but it isnt something i cant stand but i wonder if i am harming my skin. i will keep using this product for a few more days to see if i can get used to it. i dont know if that is even possible but i really would like to lighten some dark spots.since there is only 0.67 ounces is this bottle it wont last a long time. i wish lancme would put more information about this product on the listing page. at the present time there is not any bullet type selling features at all besides the one word used which is brightening.  there are the regular listing photos just not much info. since there was hardly any information when i placed my order i ordered this based solely on the product brand name of lancme but this time it is a disappointment. the bottle is beautiful but if that is what makes this serum so expensive it is a double disappointment.i am surprised that my opinion of this serum is so much lower than the other 4 reviewers who all rated this at 4 stars but based on the stinging long lasting tacky feeling lack of listing info and the perceived value at this point i cant rate this higher that 2 stars which is a surprise to even me but that is how it comes out when i rate this.  if you dont have any sensitive areas on your face then this could rate higher with you.ingredients copied from boxingredients aqua  water  eau

i had been using of vitamin c serum from another brand that i found was effective but did not also include any kind of an acid for resurfacing my skin. this one which has two interior compartments that combine upon pushing on the pump to let out just the right amount of each by reaching my actual skin rather than just some dead skin cells.i used this for a few weeks alongside my normal facial care routine and was happy to notice some visible difference in how bright my skin looked and also the texture of the surface of my skin. i felt a lot more radiant and as though my moisturizer was sinking in better as well.i really appreciate the pump dispenser which doesnt allow the product to get contaminated with bacteria and i also really like that it is not scented because i dont think fragrances have any role in skincare for the face and generally find them irritating. overall this is just a very effective thoughtfully designed product which works. highly effective glycolic and vitamin c serum,using vitamin c serum another brand found effective not also include kind acid resurfacing skin . one two interior compartments combine upon pushing pump let right amount reaching actual skin rather dead skin cells.i used weeks alongside normal facial care routine happy notice visible difference bright skin looked also texture surface skin . felt lot radiant though moisturizer sinking better well.i really appreciate pump dispenser doesnt allow product get contaminated bacteria also really like not scented dont think fragrances role skincare face generally find irritating . overall effective thoughtfully designed product works . highly effective glycolic vitamin c serum,"['using', 'vitamin', 'c', 'serum', 'another', 'brand', 'found', 'effective', 'not', 'also', 'include', 'kind', 'acid', 'resurfacing', 'skin', '.', 'one', 'two', 'interior', 'compartments', 'combine', 'upon', 'pushing', 'pump', 'let', 'right', 'amount', 'reaching', 'actual', 'skin', 'rather', 'dead', 'skin', 'cells.i', 'used', 'weeks', 'alongside', 'normal', 'facial', 'care', 'routine', 'happy', 'notice', 'visible', 'difference', 'bright', 'skin', 'looked', 'also', 'texture', 'surface', 'skin', '.', 'felt', 'lot', 'radiant', 'though', 'moisturizer', 'sinking', 'better', 'well.i', 'really', 'appreciate', 'pump', 'dispenser', 'doesnt', 'allow', 'product', 'get', 'contaminated', 'bacteria', 'also', 'really', 'like', 'not', 'scented', 'dont', 'think', 'fragrances', 'role', 'skincare', 'face', 'generally', 'find', 'irritating', '.', 'overall', 'effective', 'thoughtfully', 'designed', 'product', 'works', '.', 'highly', 'effective', 'glycolic', 'vitamin', 'c', 'serum']"

my wife is skin care enthusiasm and she works in cosmetic industry. when she saw this product she told me to get it immediately. she tried so many skin care product and the only 2 ingredients she swears by are vitamin c and retinol. they are proven ingredients to minimize dark spot improve skin discoloration. from her knowledge she said murad is founded and developed by demonologist. their products are innovative and trusted.this vitamin c serum is in a pump bottle which contains 2 small chambers. in this form of packaging the serum is more hygiene and stabilized. vitamin c is very sensitive to lights and heat so it oxidizes really fast the serum does not have any scent and it is light weight which is great for sensitive skin as well. it does not suffocate skin in summer. i dont like heavy serum on my face i sweat a lot during summer. there is little brightening sparkle when you pump it out on hand. but when you put on skin it disappears and makes skin look brighter immediately. to minimize sun spots on my face i will have to test it longer to give a conclusion. my face never feels so refreshing and clean after using it. after putting this vitamin c serum i follow with sunscreen. it is essential in skin care routine.i highly recommend this serum to any men and women with all skin type. thanks to my wifes recommendation.  now i use it daily.  who doesnt want to keep youth as long as possible ,wife skin care enthusiasm works cosmetic industry . saw product told get immediately . tried many skin care product 2 ingredients swears vitamin c retinol . proven ingredients minimize dark spot improve skin discoloration . knowledge said murad founded developed demonologist . products innovative trusted.this vitamin c serum pump bottle contains 2 small chambers . form packaging serum hygiene stabilized . vitamin c sensitive lights heat oxidizes really fast serum not scent light weight great sensitive skin well . not suffocate skin summer . dont like heavy serum face sweat lot summer . little brightening sparkle pump hand . put skin disappears makes skin look brighter immediately . minimize sun spots face test longer give conclusion . face never feels refreshing clean using . putting vitamin c serum follow sunscreen . essential skin care routine.i highly recommend serum men women skin type . thanks wifes recommendation . use daily . doesnt want keep youth long possible,"['wife', 'skin', 'care', 'enthusiasm', 'works', 'cosmetic', 'industry', '.', 'saw', 'product', 'told', 'get', 'immediately', '.', 'tried', 'many', 'skin', 'care', 'product', '2', 'ingredients', 'swears', 'vitamin', 'c', 'retinol', '.', 'proven', 'ingredients', 'minimize', 'dark', 'spot', 'improve', 'skin', 'discoloration', '.', 'knowledge', 'said', 'murad', 'founded', 'developed', 'demonologist', '.', 'products', 'innovative', 'trusted.this', 'vitamin', 'c', 'serum', 'pump', 'bottle', 'contains', '2', 'small', 'chambers', '.', 'form', 'packaging', 'serum', 'hygiene', 'stabilized', '.', 'vitamin', 'c', 'sensitive', 'lights', 'heat', 'oxidizes', 'really', 'fast', 'serum', 'not', 'scent', 'light', 'weight', 'great', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'well', '.', 'not', 'suffocate', 'skin', 'summer', '.', 'dont', 'like', 'heavy', 'serum', 'face', 'sweat', 'lot', 'summer', '.', 'little', 'brightening', 'sparkle', 'pump', 'hand', '.', 'put', 'skin', 'disappears', 'makes', 'skin', 'look', 'brighter', 'immediately', '.', 'minimize', 'sun', 'spots', 'face', 'test', 'longer', 'give', 'conclusion', '.', 'face', 'never', 'feels', 'refreshing', 'clean', 'using', '.', 'putting', 'vitamin', 'c', 'serum', 'follow', 'sunscreen', '.', 'essential', 'skin', 'care', 'routine.i', 'highly', 'recommend', 'serum', 'men', 'women', 'skin', 'type', '.', 'thanks', 'wifes', 'recommendation', '.', 'use', 'daily', '.', 'doesnt', 'want', 'keep', 'youth', 'long', 'possible']"

ive used murad products for years and have always had good luck with them so i wanted to try this one. its very lightweight and soaks in quickly. you only need one pump to cover your entire face. i put this on first after washing my face and by the time ive put on some eye cream it has absorbed enough that i can use another serum over it without it balling up or coming off. obviously this depends on what serum you are putting on top of it but its nice that it doesnt need a lot of time to absorb.ive been using it for a couple of weeks or so and im not sure if i see a difference or not but my skin feels nice so im going to keep using it. i do use a good sunscreen 50 spf because this can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. and im just using this as part of my day routine at the moment. i may start using it twice a day but i wanted to see if just once a day would produce any results because i already use two serums at night.so far i love it. murad always makes quality products so i recommend trying them. ,ive used murad products years always good luck wanted try one . lightweight soaks quickly . need one pump cover entire face . put first washing face time ive put eye cream absorbed enough use another serum without balling coming . obviously depends serum putting top nice doesnt need lot time absorb.ive using couple weeks im not sure see difference not skin feels nice im going keep using . use good sunscreen 50 spf make skin sensitive sun . im using part day routine moment . may start using twice day wanted see day would produce results already use two serums night.so far love . murad always makes quality products recommend trying .,"['ive', 'used', 'murad', 'products', 'years', 'always', 'good', 'luck', 'wanted', 'try', 'one', '.', 'lightweight', 'soaks', 'quickly', '.', 'need', 'one', 'pump', 'cover', 'entire', 'face', '.', 'put', 'first', 'washing', 'face', 'time', 'ive', 'put', 'eye', 'cream', 'absorbed', 'enough', 'use', 'another', 'serum', 'without', 'balling', 'coming', '.', 'obviously', 'depends', 'serum', 'putting', 'top', 'nice', 'doesnt', 'need', 'lot', 'time', 'absorb.ive', 'using', 'couple', 'weeks', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'see', 'difference', 'not', 'skin', 'feels', 'nice', 'im', 'going', 'keep', 'using', '.', 'use', 'good', 'sunscreen', '50', 'spf', 'make', 'skin', 'sensitive', 'sun', '.', 'im', 'using', 'part', 'day', 'routine', 'moment', '.', 'may', 'start', 'using', 'twice', 'day', 'wanted', 'see', 'day', 'would', 'produce', 'results', 'already', 'use', 'two', 'serums', 'night.so', 'far', 'love', '.', 'murad', 'always', 'makes', 'quality', 'products', 'recommend', 'trying', '.']"

i like to switch up products for my skin because the truth is your skin has different needs depending on the season and it does grow accustomed to the same product over time. also since no product can cover all the things your skin needs switching things up means your skin is getting different things to meet its needs.with that said i used this serum for a week. i put it on after cleaning my face and using a toner. then after a few minutes i use one of my usual skin creams. since its sometimes hard to tell the small affect on the face i also used it on one of my hands for a week.results when first applied i can notice immediate difference to the hand that i applied this to versus the hand that used all the same products minus this one. the fine linkeswrinkles on that hand were less pronounced and my skin even seem more full. since it is an oil it also gave my skin a very soft and light glow.  however the affect did not last longer than a few hours. then my skin was back to what it was before.in the course of a week i didnt notice any dark spots fading or my skin showed any long lasting improvements.so overall i wont say i recommend this product but i wont discourage anyone from trying either.one important note while the bottle is pretty and its neat how the solution is separated make sure you shake the bottle well prior to use. also you want to empty the dropper prior to use or after each use. else the dropper might have serum that is not properly mixed. pretty bottle  but no lasting affects,like switch products skin truth skin different needs depending season grow accustomed product time . also since no product cover things skin needs switching things means skin getting different things meet needs.with said used serum week . put cleaning face using toner . minutes use one usual skin creams . since sometimes hard tell small affect face also used one hands week.results first applied notice immediate difference hand applied versus hand used products minus one . fine linkeswrinkles hand less pronounced skin even seem full . since oil also gave skin soft light glow . however affect not last longer hours . skin back before.in course week didnt notice dark spots fading skin showed long lasting improvements.so overall wont say recommend product wont discourage anyone trying either.one important note bottle pretty neat solution separated make sure shake bottle well prior use . also want empty dropper prior use use . else dropper might serum not properly mixed . pretty bottle no lasting affects,"['like', 'switch', 'products', 'skin', 'truth', 'skin', 'different', 'needs', 'depending', 'season', 'grow', 'accustomed', 'product', 'time', '.', 'also', 'since', 'no', 'product', 'cover', 'things', 'skin', 'needs', 'switching', 'things', 'means', 'skin', 'getting', 'different', 'things', 'meet', 'needs.with', 'said', 'used', 'serum', 'week', '.', 'put', 'cleaning', 'face', 'using', 'toner', '.', 'minutes', 'use', 'one', 'usual', 'skin', 'creams', '.', 'since', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'tell', 'small', 'affect', 'face', 'also', 'used', 'one', 'hands', 'week.results', 'first', 'applied', 'notice', 'immediate', 'difference', 'hand', 'applied', 'versus', 'hand', 'used', 'products', 'minus', 'one', '.', 'fine', 'linkeswrinkles', 'hand', 'less', 'pronounced', 'skin', 'even', 'seem', 'full', '.', 'since', 'oil', 'also', 'gave', 'skin', 'soft', 'light', 'glow', '.', 'however', 'affect', 'not', 'last', 'longer', 'hours', '.', 'skin', 'back', 'before.in', 'course', 'week', 'didnt', 'notice', 'dark', 'spots', 'fading', 'skin', 'showed', 'long', 'lasting', 'improvements.so', 'overall', 'wont', 'say', 'recommend', 'product', 'wont', 'discourage', 'anyone', 'trying', 'either.one', 'important', 'note', 'bottle', 'pretty', 'neat', 'solution', 'separated', 'make', 'sure', 'shake', 'bottle', 'well', 'prior', 'use', '.', 'also', 'want', 'empty', 'dropper', 'prior', 'use', 'use', '.', 'else', 'dropper', 'might', 'serum', 'not', 'properly', 'mixed', '.', 'pretty', 'bottle', 'no', 'lasting', 'affects']"

the product is made in the usa. the serum is easy to dispense from the bottle. there is no fragrance added but there is an odor when applying the serum to my face. the odor dissipates quickly but it is initially not pleasant.  i have been using it for about 10 days and find there is mild skin irritation particularly around either side of my nose where it is red following application. additionally a couple of pimples have appeared in the treatment areas. comparing beforeafter pictures i dont detect any difference in skin tone. ,product made usa . serum easy dispense bottle . no fragrance added odor applying serum face . odor dissipates quickly initially not pleasant . using 10 days find mild skin irritation particularly around either side nose red following application . additionally couple pimples appeared treatment areas . comparing beforeafter pictures dont detect difference skin tone .,"['product', 'made', 'usa', '.', 'serum', 'easy', 'dispense', 'bottle', '.', 'no', 'fragrance', 'added', 'odor', 'applying', 'serum', 'face', '.', 'odor', 'dissipates', 'quickly', 'initially', 'not', 'pleasant', '.', 'using', '10', 'days', 'find', 'mild', 'skin', 'irritation', 'particularly', 'around', 'either', 'side', 'nose', 'red', 'following', 'application', '.', 'additionally', 'couple', 'pimples', 'appeared', 'treatment', 'areas', '.', 'comparing', 'beforeafter', 'pictures', 'dont', 'detect', 'difference', 'skin', 'tone', '.']"
ive only been using this for a little over a week now so i havent seen any noticeable differences but so far my experience with this serum has been good. it has not irritated my skin at all and seems to be very gentle but hopefully not so gentle that its ineffective. theres no added fragrance that i can detect always a good thing for my picky skin its somewhat creamy and it absorbs well and a little bit goes farther than youd think. the bottle is somewhat small as serums often are but it should still last me awhile because of how little i need for each use. im hoping that with another month or so of use ill be able to start seeing some improvement. ,ive using little week havent seen noticeable differences far experience serum good . not irritated skin seems gentle hopefully not gentle ineffective . theres no added fragrance detect always good thing picky skin somewhat creamy absorbs well little bit goes farther youd think . bottle somewhat small serums often still last awhile little need use . im hoping another month use ill able start seeing improvement .,"['ive', 'using', 'little', 'week', 'havent', 'seen', 'noticeable', 'differences', 'far', 'experience', 'serum', 'good', '.', 'not', 'irritated', 'skin', 'seems', 'gentle', 'hopefully', 'not', 'gentle', 'ineffective', '.', 'theres', 'no', 'added', 'fragrance', 'detect', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'picky', 'skin', 'somewhat', 'creamy', 'absorbs', 'well', 'little', 'bit', 'goes', 'farther', 'youd', 'think', '.', 'bottle', 'somewhat', 'small', 'serums', 'often', 'still', 'last', 'awhile', 'little', 'need', 'use', '.', 'im', 'hoping', 'another', 'month', 'use', 'ill', 'able', 'start', 'seeing', 'improvement', '.']"

this serum has a creamy appearance and texture. it goes on smoothly and has a whisper of a scent that i attribute to the niacinamide. the very mild scent is hard to describe but the best i can do is a mix of corn chips and glue. i know that sounds offputting but it is actually very slight and shouldnt deter you from ordering this product unless you cant stand any smell at all. slight scent aside i like this serum. it is easy to apply and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasiness or tackiness. i like the pump on the bottle. it allows me to get as much or as little serum as i want. i have been using this serum for a little over a week and it hasnt caused any irritation or redness. while i havent seen a noticeable difference in my dark spots yet my skin does appear to be brighter and more evenly toned. i will continue to use this serum in hopes that it does fade some dark spots on my face. i am also very careful to use sunblock whenever i use this product. overall i like this mild serum and feel like it is a good introduction for people who arent used to niacinamide. ,serum creamy appearance texture . goes smoothly whisper scent attribute niacinamide . mild scent hard describe best mix corn chips glue . know sounds offputting actually slight shouldnt deter ordering product unless cant stand smell . slight scent aside like serum . easy apply absorbs quickly without leaving greasiness tackiness . like pump bottle . allows get much little serum want . using serum little week hasnt caused irritation redness . havent seen noticeable difference dark spots yet skin appear brighter evenly toned . continue use serum hopes fade dark spots face . also careful use sunblock whenever use product . overall like mild serum feel like good introduction people arent used niacinamide .,"['serum', 'creamy', 'appearance', 'texture', '.', 'goes', 'smoothly', 'whisper', 'scent', 'attribute', 'niacinamide', '.', 'mild', 'scent', 'hard', 'describe', 'best', 'mix', 'corn', 'chips', 'glue', '.', 'know', 'sounds', 'offputting', 'actually', 'slight', 'shouldnt', 'deter', 'ordering', 'product', 'unless', 'cant', 'stand', 'smell', '.', 'slight', 'scent', 'aside', 'like', 'serum', '.', 'easy', 'apply', 'absorbs', 'quickly', 'without', 'leaving', 'greasiness', 'tackiness', '.', 'like', 'pump', 'bottle', '.', 'allows', 'get', 'much', 'little', 'serum', 'want', '.', 'using', 'serum', 'little', 'week', 'hasnt', 'caused', 'irritation', 'redness', '.', 'havent', 'seen', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'dark', 'spots', 'yet', 'skin', 'appear', 'brighter', 'evenly', 'toned', '.', 'continue', 'use', 'serum', 'hopes', 'fade', 'dark', 'spots', 'face', '.', 'also', 'careful', 'use', 'sunblock', 'whenever', 'use', 'product', '.', 'overall', 'like', 'mild', 'serum', 'feel', 'like', 'good', 'introduction', 'people', 'arent', 'used', 'niacinamide', '.']"

ive never tried this brand so i wasnt entirely sure what to expect but im very happy with the results especially at the price point. the serum is unscented and goes on very smooth. i have somewhat sensitive skin and this didnt cause any irritation at all probably due to the lack of scent. it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesnt leave any tackiness or residue and wears well under moisturizer and makeup. i havent noticed a ton of difference in dark spots fading but ive only been using it for a week and the fact that there is a slight difference tells me it probably is pretty effective over time. would definitely recommend especially for the price. ,ive never tried brand wasnt entirely sure expect im happy results especially price point . serum unscented goes smooth . somewhat sensitive skin didnt cause irritation probably due lack scent . absorbs quickly skin doesnt leave tackiness residue wears well moisturizer makeup . havent noticed ton difference dark spots fading ive using week fact slight difference tells probably pretty effective time . would definitely recommend especially price .,"['ive', 'never', 'tried', 'brand', 'wasnt', 'entirely', 'sure', 'expect', 'im', 'happy', 'results', 'especially', 'price', 'point', '.', 'serum', 'unscented', 'goes', 'smooth', '.', 'somewhat', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'didnt', 'cause', 'irritation', 'probably', 'due', 'lack', 'scent', '.', 'absorbs', 'quickly', 'skin', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'tackiness', 'residue', 'wears', 'well', 'moisturizer', 'makeup', '.', 'havent', 'noticed', 'ton', 'difference', 'dark', 'spots', 'fading', 'ive', 'using', 'week', 'fact', 'slight', 'difference', 'tells', 'probably', 'pretty', 'effective', 'time', '.', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'especially', 'price', '.']"
this curology dark spot serum is a decent serum so far. ive heard great things about curology skincare products so was excited to try it.i have fairly sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions. but i do use niacinamide in my skincare routine frequently and know my skin reacts well to it. if youre unsure how your skin reacts to niacinamide definitely do some spot testing prior to using.the serum is a milky like substance. it goes on a bit sticky but once fully absorbed the stickiness goes away.it has some great ingredients with some great benefits such as glycolic acid aha tranexamic acid kojic acid and licorice root extract all of these ingredients are supposed to help boost cell turnover for fresher smoother skin. niacinamide which is supposed to help improve moisture barrier function.its way too early to see any differences just yet. i am hopeful as ive heard great things about this brand and have some sun spots and blemish spots that need to go so hopefully this serum is the solution if i do not see any changes after finishing the whole bottle i will come back and update my review. decent serum so far,curology dark spot serum decent serum far . ive heard great things curology skincare products excited try it.i fairly sensitive skin no adverse reactions . use niacinamide skincare routine frequently know skin reacts well . youre unsure skin reacts niacinamide definitely spot testing prior using.the serum milky like substance . goes bit sticky fully absorbed stickiness goes away.it great ingredients great benefits glycolic acid aha tranexamic acid kojic acid licorice root extract ingredients supposed help boost cell turnover fresher smoother skin . niacinamide supposed help improve moisture barrier function.its way early see differences yet . hopeful ive heard great things brand sun spots blemish spots need go hopefully serum solution not see changes finishing whole bottle come back update review . decent serum far,"['curology', 'dark', 'spot', 'serum', 'decent', 'serum', 'far', '.', 'ive', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'curology', 'skincare', 'products', 'excited', 'try', 'it.i', 'fairly', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'no', 'adverse', 'reactions', '.', 'use', 'niacinamide', 'skincare', 'routine', 'frequently', 'know', 'skin', 'reacts', 'well', '.', 'youre', 'unsure', 'skin', 'reacts', 'niacinamide', 'definitely', 'spot', 'testing', 'prior', 'using.the', 'serum', 'milky', 'like', 'substance', '.', 'goes', 'bit', 'sticky', 'fully', 'absorbed', 'stickiness', 'goes', 'away.it', 'great', 'ingredients', 'great', 'benefits', 'glycolic', 'acid', 'aha', 'tranexamic', 'acid', 'kojic', 'acid', 'licorice', 'root', 'extract', 'ingredients', 'supposed', 'help', 'boost', 'cell', 'turnover', 'fresher', 'smoother', 'skin', '.', 'niacinamide', 'supposed', 'help', 'improve', 'moisture', 'barrier', 'function.its', 'way', 'early', 'see', 'differences', 'yet', '.', 'hopeful', 'ive', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'brand', 'sun', 'spots', 'blemish', 'spots', 'need', 'go', 'hopefully', 'serum', 'solution', 'not', 'see', 'changes', 'finishing', 'whole', 'bottle', 'come', 'back', 'update', 'review', '.', 'decent', 'serum', 'far']"

i bought this from ulta and realized only later that i couldve simply bought it for 20 cheaper on amazon. ive been having premature aging around my face and most especially as soon as i hit my birthday im in my 20s all of a sudden i had deep forehead wrinkles probably because i make too many facial expressions. my forehead was the one area that never used to give me trouble and i was proud of that but now it became a huge worry. a friend recommended this product and i bought it thinking it wouldnt do much. a mere 23 days later all of a sudden i just saw a huge difference not only saw but felt my forehead and i have no idea about the science behind this suddenly felt tighter and less baggy reducing the appearance of wrinkles significantly. i also have hyperpigmentation especially around the beard area and it was getting bad to worse. that cleared up by about 60 this is i think my second week using them and im beyond happy and i hope it stays working. my mom also started using it before me and she has pcos so has dark areas around her mouth and sides of her face. on the first day she used it you could tell the difference it was amazing because in the last 20 years she had tried everything and it would not fade away but all of a sudden it was like magic. shes happier and confident as am i it feels great my friend also recommended their vitamin c serum and i may try that next. not going to lie the price tag is way too much but in the end for the way this product works quickly and efficiently i think ill take that extra stretch in price. i also saw some reviews mention the scent so yes it has quite a strong scent but so far that hasnt done anything negative in fact i find it quite pleasant in my opinion.for the way i apply it i simply cleanse my skin with a cleanser i use cerave foaming wash does the job and then dry my face and ensure it is completely dry then i apply retinol on my face and neck. it says 23 drops but im pretty sure i use more of that not sure if thats a me thing or a bad thing but it works. your supposed to pay the retinol in but because im in a rush these last 3ish nights also use at night plz ive been smearing it like lotion and i can already tell thats not the way to go. so pat dont smear. next i wait 15 minutes for it to dry and really set in. i set a timer. lastly once its dry and the timer is up i apply a moisturizer that has vitamin c in it. patting this in helps more than smearing i usually do a mix of both. when you wake up in the morning please wear sunscreen. it will protect your skin from the sensitivity that retinol has in the sun.i hope this was helpful really love this product and hope it continues to work hopefully ill come back to update as time go was along currently on week 2 of use works like a

i did not take a before photo because lets face it these types of products dont usually deliver the results they tout. well my dermatologist recommended a regime including retinol. i came across this and liked the fact it was a cream as retinol dries out my skin. at this price point i thought at the very least it will be good for my skin. ive been using it for about 6 weeks still on my first jar nightly as directed and to my surprise i can see results. the fine lines around the corner of my eyes are significantly better my deep laugh lines are definitely smoother. and the expression lines on my forehead are significantly less noticeable. i wasnt looking for the results. i just happened to notice the other night after showering as i went to use it. i have to add that i love the product as a moisturizer. its creamy without leaving my skin feeling greasy. it absorbs so well that i sometimes even use argan oil or cetaphil on top after it has absorbed completely. i do wear sunscreen on my face when i leave the house as recommended. i am 48 years old and was a queen when it came to sun worshipping. of course now i wish i hadnt gotten so much sun but this has been effective at undoing some of the damage. i have sensitive skin and have had no irritation. i highly recommend this to young and more mature skin alike ,not take photo lets face types products dont usually deliver results tout . well dermatologist recommended regime including retinol . came across liked fact cream retinol dries skin . price point thought least good skin . ive using 6 weeks still first jar nightly directed surprise see results . fine lines around corner eyes significantly better deep laugh lines definitely smoother . expression lines forehead significantly less noticeable . wasnt looking results . happened notice night showering went use . add love product moisturizer . creamy without leaving skin feeling greasy . absorbs well sometimes even use argan oil cetaphil top absorbed completely . wear sunscreen face leave house recommended . 48 years old queen came sun worshipping . course wish hadnt gotten much sun effective undoing damage . sensitive skin no irritation . highly recommend young mature skin alike,"['not', 'take', 'photo', 'lets', 'face', 'types', 'products', 'dont', 'usually', 'deliver', 'results', 'tout', '.', 'well', 'dermatologist', 'recommended', 'regime', 'including', 'retinol', '.', 'came', 'across', 'liked', 'fact', 'cream', 'retinol', 'dries', 'skin', '.', 'price', 'point', 'thought', 'least', 'good', 'skin', '.', 'ive', 'using', '6', 'weeks', 'still', 'first', 'jar', 'nightly', 'directed', 'surprise', 'see', 'results', '.', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'corner', 'eyes', 'significantly', 'better', 'deep', 'laugh', 'lines', 'definitely', 'smoother', '.', 'expression', 'lines', 'forehead', 'significantly', 'less', 'noticeable', '.', 'wasnt', 'looking', 'results', '.', 'happened', 'notice', 'night', 'showering', 'went', 'use', '.', 'add', 'love', 'product', 'moisturizer', '.', 'creamy', 'without', 'leaving', 'skin', 'feeling', 'greasy', '.', 'absorbs', 'well', 'sometimes', 'even', 'use', 'argan', 'oil', 'cetaphil', 'top', 'absorbed', 'completely', '.', 'wear', 'sunscreen', 'face', 'leave', 'house', 'recommended', '.', '48', 'years', 'old', 'queen', 'came', 'sun', 'worshipping', '.', 'course', 'wish', 'hadnt', 'gotten', 'much', 'sun', 'effective', 'undoing', 'damage', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'no', 'irritation', '.', 'highly', 'recommend', 'young', 'mature', 'skin', 'alike']"

ive suffered from adult acne since my late 20s. ive tried retinols before but a lot of them end up being too strong or too drying. or if they have a good balance of strength and moisture decent freaks me out. this does none of that. i am fair skinned and i do use cicapair during the day. the green tent to that has very much help me not getting sunburned. because it seems like any products that i put on my face especially if theyre moisturizing seem to still cause me to burn. the green tent has stopped all of that. i did not use that in combination with any past retinol products unfortunately. so i cant speak to how other products would cause my face to burn now. however this by itself at night or used during the day under the cicapair has been marvelous. it took about a week to show drastic results even though i could actually tell a difference with my find lines and acne the next day. but several products will seem right for the first few days but in longterm use they will cause irritation despite cutting back. now i have no more fine lines on my forehead as well as reduce fine lines around my eyes when i smile by about 50. this product is definitely authentic and worth the money. honestly its worth the money full price. but if you can get it now on amazon at this price i would go ahead and buy three like i did this is great product for adult acne,ive suffered adult acne since late 20s . ive tried retinols lot end strong drying . good balance strength moisture decent freaks . none . fair skinned use cicapair day . green tent much help not getting sunburned . seems like products put face especially theyre moisturizing seem still cause burn . green tent stopped . not use combination past retinol products unfortunately . cant speak products would cause face burn . however night used day cicapair marvelous . took week show drastic results even though could actually tell difference find lines acne next day . several products seem right first days longterm use cause irritation despite cutting back . no fine lines forehead well reduce fine lines around eyes smile 50. product definitely authentic worth money . honestly worth money full price . get amazon price would go ahead buy three like great product adult acne,"['ive', 'suffered', 'adult', 'acne', 'since', 'late', '20s', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'retinols', 'lot', 'end', 'strong', 'drying', '.', 'good', 'balance', 'strength', 'moisture', 'decent', 'freaks', '.', 'none', '.', 'fair', 'skinned', 'use', 'cicapair', 'day', '.', 'green', 'tent', 'much', 'help', 'not', 'getting', 'sunburned', '.', 'seems', 'like', 'products', 'put', 'face', 'especially', 'theyre', 'moisturizing', 'seem', 'still', 'cause', 'burn', '.', 'green', 'tent', 'stopped', '.', 'not', 'use', 'combination', 'past', 'retinol', 'products', 'unfortunately', '.', 'cant', 'speak', 'products', 'would', 'cause', 'face', 'burn', '.', 'however', 'night', 'used', 'day', 'cicapair', 'marvelous', '.', 'took', 'week', 'show', 'drastic', 'results', 'even', 'though', 'could', 'actually', 'tell', 'difference', 'find', 'lines', 'acne', 'next', 'day', '.', 'several', 'products', 'seem', 'right', 'first', 'days', 'longterm', 'use', 'cause', 'irritation', 'despite', 'cutting', 'back', '.', 'no', 'fine', 'lines', 'forehead', 'well', 'reduce', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', 'smile', '50.', 'product', 'definitely', 'authentic', 'worth', 'money', '.', 'honestly', 'worth', 'money', 'full', 'price', '.', 'get', 'amazon', 'price', 'would', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'three', 'like', 'great', 'product', 'adult', 'acne']"

okay i really love this serum.  it absolutely makes my skin look glowy smooth and beautiful.  it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moisturized.  i dont get the flaking and dryness normally associated with tretinoin use.  in fact i think i get better results from my tret when i use it in conjunction with the dual phase bakuchiol.  my pores are less noticeable and its helping lighten some dark spots so i need less makeup.  all in all its probably the most effective serum ive ever tried and i have tried a lot of them.  i wont waste money on more expensive and less effective products anymore.  definitely recommendbut.the container is small and i use it twice daily so i run out very quickly.  i wish it was a standard one full ounce as most other facial serums are.  because of that ive been out of it for a week so i put it on autoship.  my first autoship order came a few days ago but the bottle leaked in transit and all of the blue layer was gone   so amazons packing could definitely use some work i think we all know this and they want me to return the halfempty bottle.  sigh. ,okay really love serum . absolutely makes skin look glowy smooth beautiful . absorbs quickly keeps skin moisturized . dont get flaking dryness normally associated tretinoin use . fact think get better results tret use conjunction dual phase bakuchiol . pores less noticeable helping lighten dark spots need less makeup . probably effective serum ive ever tried tried lot . wont waste money expensive less effective products anymore . definitely recommendbut.the container small use twice daily run quickly . wish standard one full ounce facial serums . ive week put autoship . first autoship order came days ago bottle leaked transit blue layer gone amazons packing could definitely use work think know want return halfempty bottle . sigh .,"['okay', 'really', 'love', 'serum', '.', 'absolutely', 'makes', 'skin', 'look', 'glowy', 'smooth', 'beautiful', '.', 'absorbs', 'quickly', 'keeps', 'skin', 'moisturized', '.', 'dont', 'get', 'flaking', 'dryness', 'normally', 'associated', 'tretinoin', 'use', '.', 'fact', 'think', 'get', 'better', 'results', 'tret', 'use', 'conjunction', 'dual', 'phase', 'bakuchiol', '.', 'pores', 'less', 'noticeable', 'helping', 'lighten', 'dark', 'spots', 'need', 'less', 'makeup', '.', 'probably', 'effective', 'serum', 'ive', 'ever', 'tried', 'tried', 'lot', '.', 'wont', 'waste', 'money', 'expensive', 'less', 'effective', 'products', 'anymore', '.', 'definitely', 'recommendbut.the', 'container', 'small', 'use', 'twice', 'daily', 'run', 'quickly', '.', 'wish', 'standard', 'one', 'full', 'ounce', 'facial', 'serums', '.', 'ive', 'week', 'put', 'autoship', '.', 'first', 'autoship', 'order', 'came', 'days', 'ago', 'bottle', 'leaked', 'transit', 'blue', 'layer', 'gone', 'amazons', 'packing', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 'work', 'think', 'know', 'want', 'return', 'halfempty', 'bottle', '.', 'sigh', '.']"

this item is my favorite skin care product i have ever used. its amazingly moisturizing and eliminated my redness to the point that i now go with out makeup most of the time. i have really enjoyed using acure products.however the last time i ordered this it came in 2 smaller bottles which were only half way full. im not sure if it had been opened before but the yellow part of the serum had solidified and would not mix when shaken. it was so thick and sticky it had stopped the dropper so it was unusable. it smelled a little different and i did not use the product. i am going to try buying it again and hope that my next order will be back to the usual quality. best product but something seems to have changed,item favorite skin care product ever used . amazingly moisturizing eliminated redness point go makeup time . really enjoyed using acure products.however last time ordered came 2 smaller bottles half way full . im not sure opened yellow part serum solidified would not mix shaken . thick sticky stopped dropper unusable . smelled little different not use product . going try buying hope next order back usual quality . best product something seems changed,"['item', 'favorite', 'skin', 'care', 'product', 'ever', 'used', '.', 'amazingly', 'moisturizing', 'eliminated', 'redness', 'point', 'go', 'makeup', 'time', '.', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'using', 'acure', 'products.however', 'last', 'time', 'ordered', 'came', '2', 'smaller', 'bottles', 'half', 'way', 'full', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'opened', 'yellow', 'part', 'serum', 'solidified', 'would', 'not', 'mix', 'shaken', '.', 'thick', 'sticky', 'stopped', 'dropper', 'unusable', '.', 'smelled', 'little', 'different', 'not', 'use', 'product', '.', 'going', 'try', 'buying', 'hope', 'next', 'order', 'back', 'usual', 'quality', '.', 'best', 'product', 'something', 'seems', 'changed']"
i received this item twicewith one being the original order and the other being a replacement that was offered to me. each time i did not receive what i ordered. instead of a single .67 ounce bottle i received two .33 ounce bottles that were half full. i was bothered by that and felt so slighted. to me it was like me ordering a 32 ounce bottle of something and then someone decides to send me four bottles with less than 8 ounces without asking me if it would be okay.i decided to contact acure myself to inquire as to how would they send out .67 ounces if it were ordered directly from them and if the bottles would be half full.well acure shared with me that the .33oz bottles are tester bottles and explained that there is space left in the bottle for shaking  but that it should not be half empty. they asked me for the numbers on the bottom of the boxes after researching they shared with me that the boxes that i received were expired made in 2021. they further shared their products are good for three years and the ones that i received expired in april.all i suggest is to be careful. make sure you receive exactly what you ordered and make sure its not expired. note  what acure sent me was not scented wheres the bottles i received when i ordered from this vendor were scented. ,received item twicewith one original order replacement offered . time not receive ordered . instead single .67 ounce bottle received two .33 ounce bottles half full . bothered felt slighted . like ordering 32 ounce bottle something someone decides send four bottles less 8 ounces without asking would okay.i decided contact acure inquire would send .67 ounces ordered directly bottles would half full.well acure shared .33oz bottles tester bottles explained space left bottle shaking not half empty . asked numbers bottom boxes researching shared boxes received expired made 2021. shared products good three years ones received expired april.all suggest careful . make sure receive exactly ordered make sure not expired . note acure sent not scented wheres bottles received ordered vendor scented .,"['received', 'item', 'twicewith', 'one', 'original', 'order', 'replacement', 'offered', '.', 'time', 'not', 'receive', 'ordered', '.', 'instead', 'single', '.67', 'ounce', 'bottle', 'received', 'two', '.33', 'ounce', 'bottles', 'half', 'full', '.', 'bothered', 'felt', 'slighted', '.', 'like', 'ordering', '32', 'ounce', 'bottle', 'something', 'someone', 'decides', 'send', 'four', 'bottles', 'less', '8', 'ounces', 'without', 'asking', 'would', 'okay.i', 'decided', 'contact', 'acure', 'inquire', 'would', 'send', '.67', 'ounces', 'ordered', 'directly', 'bottles', 'would', 'half', 'full.well', 'acure', 'shared', '.33oz', 'bottles', 'tester', 'bottles', 'explained', 'space', 'left', 'bottle', 'shaking', 'not', 'half', 'empty', '.', 'asked', 'numbers', 'bottom', 'boxes', 'researching', 'shared', 'boxes', 'received', 'expired', 'made', '2021.', 'shared', 'products', 'good', 'three', 'years', 'ones', 'received', 'expired', 'april.all', 'suggest', 'careful', '.', 'make', 'sure', 'receive', 'exactly', 'ordered', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'expired', '.', 'note', 'acure', 'sent', 'not', 'scented', 'wheres', 'bottles', 'received', 'ordered', 'vendor', 'scented', '.']"
