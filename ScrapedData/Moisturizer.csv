this is one of my top three favorite facial moisturizers. it has a luscious texture doesnt have any fragrance and leaves my skin soft without being shiny. so why did i rate it only 3 stars because the packaging is so egregiously wasteful it infuriates me. they made the outer box big enough to fit two jars but it comes with one jar held in place by more cardboard so it doesnt rattle around. and the jar is the absolute worst. i have posted some images of a side by side comparison with another facial moisturizer so you can see for yourself. the aveeno jar is larger but holds less product than the other brand. aveeno 1.7 oz in a 2.5 diameter plastic jar 11.10 oz at time of this review mad hippie 2.1 oz in a 2.125 diameter glass jar 13.33oz at time of this review the aveeno jar has a double wall creating the illusion that it is a much bigger amount of product. it is a shameful waste of material and even though i love the moisturizer it makes me so mad that i frequently go to other brands that have less wasteful packaging practices. if it wasnt for the packaging this moisturizer would definitely be 4 stars or even 5 for me but i just cannot abide by companies using resources in such a careless and disingenuous way. it is irresponsible and unnecessary. wonderful moisturizer shamefully wasteful packaging,one top three favorite facial moisturizers . luscious texture doesnt fragrance leaves skin soft without shiny . rate 3 stars packaging egregiously wasteful infuriates . made outer box big enough fit two jars comes one jar held place cardboard doesnt rattle around . jar absolute worst . posted images side side comparison another facial moisturizer see . aveeno jar larger holds less product brand . aveeno 1.7 oz 2.5 diameter plastic jar 11.10 oz time review mad hippie 2.1 oz 2.125 diameter glass jar 13.33oz time review aveeno jar double wall creating illusion much bigger amount product . shameful waste material even though love moisturizer makes mad frequently go brands less wasteful packaging practices . wasnt packaging moisturizer would definitely 4 stars even 5 not abide companies using resources careless disingenuous way . irresponsible unnecessary . wonderful moisturizer shamefully wasteful packaging,"['one', 'top', 'three', 'favorite', 'facial', 'moisturizers', '.', 'luscious', 'texture', 'doesnt', 'fragrance', 'leaves', 'skin', 'soft', 'without', 'shiny', '.', 'rate', '3', 'stars', 'packaging', 'egregiously', 'wasteful', 'infuriates', '.', 'made', 'outer', 'box', 'big', 'enough', 'fit', 'two', 'jars', 'comes', 'one', 'jar', 'held', 'place', 'cardboard', 'doesnt', 'rattle', 'around', '.', 'jar', 'absolute', 'worst', '.', 'posted', 'images', 'side', 'side', 'comparison', 'another', 'facial', 'moisturizer', 'see', '.', 'aveeno', 'jar', 'larger', 'holds', 'less', 'product', 'brand', '.', 'aveeno', '1.7', 'oz', '2.5', 'diameter', 'plastic', 'jar', '11.10', 'oz', 'time', 'review', 'mad', 'hippie', '2.1', 'oz', '2.125', 'diameter', 'glass', 'jar', '13.33oz', 'time', 'review', 'aveeno', 'jar', 'double', 'wall', 'creating', 'illusion', 'much', 'bigger', 'amount', 'product', '.', 'shameful', 'waste', 'material', 'even', 'though', 'love', 'moisturizer', 'makes', 'mad', 'frequently', 'go', 'brands', 'less', 'wasteful', 'packaging', 'practices', '.', 'wasnt', 'packaging', 'moisturizer', 'would', 'definitely', '4', 'stars', 'even', '5', 'not', 'abide', 'companies', 'using', 'resources', 'careless', 'disingenuous', 'way', '.', 'irresponsible', 'unnecessary', '.', 'wonderful', 'moisturizer', 'shamefully', 'wasteful', 'packaging']"

another reviewer i noticed on here mentioned that this scent is different from the purple top lavender calming aveeno and thats actually true. it smells noticeably different and a little more mild in the lavender department. if thats a deal breaker for you id say skip the brown top version. but for me i actually prefer this scent its a little less sweet and for me smells a little more gender neutral. so if youre sensitive to strongsweet smells or want a yummy smelling lotion that doesnt smell too traditionally feminine this one might be for you.i have very sensitive skin and im ocd so i wash my hands many many times a day sometimes until my hands are red and cracked. so i use lotion after every hand wash to keep my hands soft and pain free. i ordered this and it was delayed a day so i was without it for about 24 hours. my hands were bright red cracked dry and hurting really badly.when i got it out of the amazon locker last night i immediately started using it. less than 24 hours later my hands are almost completely healed. they arent dry the redness is gone and there is no more pain. this is the best lotion for my sensitive skin and i tend to keep a fragrance free bottle at work to use throughout the day.if youre looking for something to soothe painful or dry skin i totally recommend this. and the scent is mild enough that you could use it all over your body and not be overwhelmed definitely recommend. different smell still amazing,another reviewer noticed mentioned scent different purple top lavender calming aveeno thats actually true . smells noticeably different little mild lavender department . thats deal breaker id say skip brown top version . actually prefer scent little less sweet smells little gender neutral . youre sensitive strongsweet smells want yummy smelling lotion doesnt smell traditionally feminine one might you.i sensitive skin im ocd wash hands many many times day sometimes hands red cracked . use lotion every hand wash keep hands soft pain free . ordered delayed day without 24 hours . hands bright red cracked dry hurting really badly.when got amazon locker last night immediately started using . less 24 hours later hands almost completely healed . arent dry redness gone no pain . best lotion sensitive skin tend keep fragrance free bottle work use throughout day.if youre looking something soothe painful dry skin totally recommend . scent mild enough could use body not overwhelmed definitely recommend . different smell still amazing,"['another', 'reviewer', 'noticed', 'mentioned', 'scent', 'different', 'purple', 'top', 'lavender', 'calming', 'aveeno', 'thats', 'actually', 'true', '.', 'smells', 'noticeably', 'different', 'little', 'mild', 'lavender', 'department', '.', 'thats', 'deal', 'breaker', 'id', 'say', 'skip', 'brown', 'top', 'version', '.', 'actually', 'prefer', 'scent', 'little', 'less', 'sweet', 'smells', 'little', 'gender', 'neutral', '.', 'youre', 'sensitive', 'strongsweet', 'smells', 'want', 'yummy', 'smelling', 'lotion', 'doesnt', 'smell', 'traditionally', 'feminine', 'one', 'might', 'you.i', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'im', 'ocd', 'wash', 'hands', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'day', 'sometimes', 'hands', 'red', 'cracked', '.', 'use', 'lotion', 'every', 'hand', 'wash', 'keep', 'hands', 'soft', 'pain', 'free', '.', 'ordered', 'delayed', 'day', 'without', '24', 'hours', '.', 'hands', 'bright', 'red', 'cracked', 'dry', 'hurting', 'really', 'badly.when', 'got', 'amazon', 'locker', 'last', 'night', 'immediately', 'started', 'using', '.', 'less', '24', 'hours', 'later', 'hands', 'almost', 'completely', 'healed', '.', 'arent', 'dry', 'redness', 'gone', 'no', 'pain', '.', 'best', 'lotion', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'tend', 'keep', 'fragrance', 'free', 'bottle', 'work', 'use', 'throughout', 'day.if', 'youre', 'looking', 'something', 'soothe', 'painful', 'dry', 'skin', 'totally', 'recommend', '.', 'scent', 'mild', 'enough', 'could', 'use', 'body', 'not', 'overwhelmed', 'definitely', 'recommend', '.', 'different', 'smell', 'still', 'amazing']"

ive been on the hunt for the perfect antiaging moisturizer and ive finally found it. this stuff is goldfirst off the fact that its fragrancefree is a huge plus for me. i have sensitive skin that tends to react poorly to added fragrances so finding a product that delivers results without the risk of irritation is a win in my book.the combination of retinol and hyaluronic acid in this moisturizer is like a onetwo punch against fine lines wrinkles and dark spots. after just a few weeks of consistent use i noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and appearance of my skin. my fine lines appear diminished my skin feels firmer and those pesky dark spots are noticeably lighter.whats also great is that it doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky like some other moisturizers ive tried in the past. it absorbs quickly and leaves behind a smooth hydrated canvas for makeup application.my only minor gripe is that retinol can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin so i had to ease into using this product every other day to avoid any potential redness or peeling. but once my skin adjusted its been smooth sailing ever since.overall if youre looking to turn back the clock on your skin without breaking the bank i highly recommend giving this a try. your future self will thank you a musthave for youthful skin,ive hunt perfect antiaging moisturizer ive finally found . stuff goldfirst fact fragrancefree huge plus . sensitive skin tends react poorly added fragrances finding product delivers results without risk irritation win book.the combination retinol hyaluronic acid moisturizer like onetwo punch fine lines wrinkles dark spots . weeks consistent use noticed significant improvement overall texture appearance skin . fine lines appear diminished skin feels firmer pesky dark spots noticeably lighter.whats also great doesnt leave skin feeling greasy sticky like moisturizers ive tried past . absorbs quickly leaves behind smooth hydrated canvas makeup application.my minor gripe retinol bit harsh sensitive skin ease using product every day avoid potential redness peeling . skin adjusted smooth sailing ever since.overall youre looking turn back clock skin without breaking bank highly recommend giving try . future self thank musthave youthful skin,"['ive', 'hunt', 'perfect', 'antiaging', 'moisturizer', 'ive', 'finally', 'found', '.', 'stuff', 'goldfirst', 'fact', 'fragrancefree', 'huge', 'plus', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'tends', 'react', 'poorly', 'added', 'fragrances', 'finding', 'product', 'delivers', 'results', 'without', 'risk', 'irritation', 'win', 'book.the', 'combination', 'retinol', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'moisturizer', 'like', 'onetwo', 'punch', 'fine', 'lines', 'wrinkles', 'dark', 'spots', '.', 'weeks', 'consistent', 'use', 'noticed', 'significant', 'improvement', 'overall', 'texture', 'appearance', 'skin', '.', 'fine', 'lines', 'appear', 'diminished', 'skin', 'feels', 'firmer', 'pesky', 'dark', 'spots', 'noticeably', 'lighter.whats', 'also', 'great', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'skin', 'feeling', 'greasy', 'sticky', 'like', 'moisturizers', 'ive', 'tried', 'past', '.', 'absorbs', 'quickly', 'leaves', 'behind', 'smooth', 'hydrated', 'canvas', 'makeup', 'application.my', 'minor', 'gripe', 'retinol', 'bit', 'harsh', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'ease', 'using', 'product', 'every', 'day', 'avoid', 'potential', 'redness', 'peeling', '.', 'skin', 'adjusted', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'ever', 'since.overall', 'youre', 'looking', 'turn', 'back', 'clock', 'skin', 'without', 'breaking', 'bank', 'highly', 'recommend', 'giving', 'try', '.', 'future', 'self', 'thank', 'musthave', 'youthful', 'skin']"

the bottle might be really cute but the pump just does not work.  i took mine apart and found that 1 the pump has no tube going into the product to help pull it up 2 even if you shake the bottle upside down to cover the pump base the product is very thick and does not fill in the hole created by the tiny amount you finally pump out and then youre back to just pumping air you can see the pocket in the cream around where the pump was.  the good news is that the seam where the pump top and the base of the bottle meet is not fixed and you can take it apart without breaking the bottle.  i just scooped it all out and put in a small jar with a regular lid.that said the cream itself is really nice.  its not greasy like most other ones ive tried and has not caused my sensitive skin to break out or become red and irritated.  because its supposed to be even more gentle than their regular face cream ive also used it on my forehead to the sides of my lips and neck.  a little bit goes a long way so even just the half ounce is going to last quite a while.im really hopeful that it will be effective after some consistent use because its definitely the only product thats been agreeable with my skin. good product bad packaging,bottle might really cute pump not work . took mine apart found 1 pump no tube going product help pull 2 even shake bottle upside cover pump base product thick not fill hole created tiny amount finally pump youre back pumping air see pocket cream around pump . good news seam pump top base bottle meet not fixed take apart without breaking bottle . scooped put small jar regular lid.that said cream really nice . not greasy like ones ive tried not caused sensitive skin break become red irritated . supposed even gentle regular face cream ive also used forehead sides lips neck . little bit goes long way even half ounce going last quite while.im really hopeful effective consistent use definitely product thats agreeable skin . good product bad packaging,"['bottle', 'might', 'really', 'cute', 'pump', 'not', 'work', '.', 'took', 'mine', 'apart', 'found', '1', 'pump', 'no', 'tube', 'going', 'product', 'help', 'pull', '2', 'even', 'shake', 'bottle', 'upside', 'cover', 'pump', 'base', 'product', 'thick', 'not', 'fill', 'hole', 'created', 'tiny', 'amount', 'finally', 'pump', 'youre', 'back', 'pumping', 'air', 'see', 'pocket', 'cream', 'around', 'pump', '.', 'good', 'news', 'seam', 'pump', 'top', 'base', 'bottle', 'meet', 'not', 'fixed', 'take', 'apart', 'without', 'breaking', 'bottle', '.', 'scooped', 'put', 'small', 'jar', 'regular', 'lid.that', 'said', 'cream', 'really', 'nice', '.', 'not', 'greasy', 'like', 'ones', 'ive', 'tried', 'not', 'caused', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'break', 'become', 'red', 'irritated', '.', 'supposed', 'even', 'gentle', 'regular', 'face', 'cream', 'ive', 'also', 'used', 'forehead', 'sides', 'lips', 'neck', '.', 'little', 'bit', 'goes', 'long', 'way', 'even', 'half', 'ounce', 'going', 'last', 'quite', 'while.im', 'really', 'hopeful', 'effective', 'consistent', 'use', 'definitely', 'product', 'thats', 'agreeable', 'skin', '.', 'good', 'product', 'bad', 'packaging']"

i never know when to leave 4 or 5 stars on something as i dont take the time to leave feedback very often. however i will say that after over a month of using this product i came back to leave feedback and i will continue to order it as i personally feel it deserves 5 stars because of what it does for me.ive had oily skin since puberty struck many many moons ago and while i no longer require a prescription for my acne like i did as a teenager the oiliness has followed me well into adulthood and i still have flareups from time to time.this cream has made a difference in my face. i feel it really helps prevent breakouts and while i wouldnt say i have any wrinkles yet im knocking on 30 years old there are trace fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes that id begun to notice before i started this cream. i feel like this keeps those from progressing and smooths them out some. i also think my makeup goes on better.this cream does not make my skin feel tight after application. in fact the cleanser i use currently to remove my makeup at the end of the day tends to and i put this on after to relieve that sensation. i dont use it every night though just to keep my skin balanced. i feel like if i used it every night it might start to dry me out but i cant say for sure if it would. i just do what i feel is right for my body chemistry.if i see a breakout coming on sometimes ill just get one ugly cystic knot on my face this stuff realllllly helps to dry it out and reduce the redness without drying out the rest of my face. the blemish will look better the next day and by day two as long as i leave it alone and dont force it itll fade or it will surface on its own and can be cleaned then will fade. that might be tmi but we all know how pimples work and getting it to surface on its own without picking or trying to pop it can be hard when you just want it gonethis may not work for everyone and i cant really attest to what it does for wrinkles but i will say that for me its great at the turnover rate for acne without being harsh like some of the prescription spot treatments i used to use when i was younger. my face just feels fresher and smoother like its getting rid of all the dead skin. if i used it every night i might not even have the occasional blemish who knowsi recommend anyone with uneven skin tone or acne issues to try it as a moisturizer. it is 100 worth it to me at this price point and a little goes a long way. i use a little over a peasized amount for my whole face. i dont have wrinkles yet but this does wonders for my adult acneprone skin,never know leave 4 5 stars something dont take time leave feedback often . however say month using product came back leave feedback continue order personally feel deserves 5 stars

i cant tell you how many face moisturizers ive used over the years. lots. i still come across half full bottles in the closest or bathroom from three or four years ago products that were too greasy too thick too irritating too smelly too watery too expensive for such poor results. ugg.but i do love st. ives. i love their body lotions hand lotions and masks so when i came across this face moisturizing i was so excited. i searched for it in stores for a couple of weeks and came away really disappointed. it seems like the only place you can buy this now is on the internet and im thrilled that amazon had such good prices. i spent around eight bucks for my 10 ounce jar and a month into the use of it morning and night ive barely made a dentill be thirty this year so i am  taking preventative steps in my skin care routine now. baby laugh lines deep thinking lines and smile wrinkles are all visible though my boyfriend says im the only one noticing at this point. i am not ready to commit to heavy duty antiwrinkle products yet but i did want a product i could use daily that would give my skin a boast. this is that productthis moisturizer soaks in quickly. it has a light floral scent smells like other products that have safflower in it and is white in color with a smooth solidish consistency. a lot goes a long way and usually i just use some of what is on the lid of the jar left there from jostling the jar around. i use it all over my face neck and decolletage. i am careful to avoid my eye area though this product is really really not eye friendly and that is the only drawback. the product warns to avoid the eye area and thats no joke. i do use a separate moisturizer for my eyes anyway and i usually apply that first so i have a good idea of where to put the face cream afterwards. a little warm water or witch hazel can calm any eye contact though.after a month i am really content with this moisturizer. it does not make my skin overly oily it does not irritate my skin  though it does bother my eyes if i get it in or near them  and it soaks in fast so i dont have to delay putting on make in the morning or laying down on my pillow at night.while i havent seen over the top super results as far as my little wrinkles go i do know my skin is consistently moisturized more even in tone softer and yes  a little bit firmer. i also love that i can layer other things on top like a primer sunscreen or powder without my skin getting clogged and gross.over all i am really pleased with this product and it is now a staple in my skin care routine. ill definitely be buying this when i run out.in about four or five months ten ounces is a lotjr im using this for life,cant tell many face moisturizers ive used years . lots . still come across half full

i wished there was a way to give this product 10 stars.let me first say im a very picky retinol user.  i usually use a high end organic product aka origins but thought id give this one a whirl given the reviews.  im a tried and proven convert now.  i love this product.  it is so luxurious never causes burning peeling or redness.  truthfully i think this is best retinol cream ive ever used and thats just how it feels on my skin.  lets talk results.usually most ads state something like 95 of users noticed improvement with wrinkles in 7 days or something along that line.  i often have wondered who are the respondents to those trials  have they ever used any product before  many women consistently dont even use a face cream yet or have an established habit of moisturizing their skin.  if not of course theyd see incredible results  ive been taking care of my skin with a normal regimen since my teens.  thanks mom  that said my skin is pretty acclimated at this point to moisturizers and antiwrinkle creams.  in short its hard to dramatically improve beyond what i currently use which are stellar but pricey products.this product changed the playing field.  with one use i could tell this was different.  im addicted now and have a hard time finishing up my other products  people at work ask me what im doing to my skin.  they tell me how super soft supple and radiant my skin looks.  i thought it was just me that noticed but others have too.  i dont want to waste any other existing product so im going to still use that up first before ordering more but once its gone ill be ordering this full time from now on.  im also going to try out their other products as well. amazing product.  incredible value.  beats my 75 serum,wished way give product 10 stars.let first say im picky retinol user . usually use high end organic product aka origins thought id give one whirl given reviews . im tried proven convert . love product . luxurious never causes burning peeling redness . truthfully think best retinol cream ive ever used thats feels skin . lets talk results.usually ads state something like 95 users noticed improvement wrinkles 7 days something along line . often wondered respondents trials ever used product many women consistently dont even use face cream yet established habit moisturizing skin . not course theyd see incredible results ive taking care skin normal regimen since teens . thanks mom said skin pretty acclimated point moisturizers antiwrinkle creams . short hard dramatically improve beyond currently use stellar pricey products.this product changed playing field . one use could tell different . im addicted hard time finishing products people work ask im skin . tell super soft supple radiant skin looks . thought noticed others . dont want waste existing product im going still use first ordering gone ill ordering full time . im also going try products well . amazing product . incredible value . beats 75 serum,"['wished', 'way', 'give', 'product', '10', 'stars.let', 'first', 'say', 'im', 'picky', 'retinol', 'user', '.', 'usually', 'use', 'high', 'end', 'organic', 'product', 'aka', 'origins', 'thought', 'id', 'give', 'one', 'whirl', 'given', 'reviews', '.', 'im', 'tried', 'proven', 'convert', '.', 'love', 'product', '.', 'luxurious', 'never', 'causes', 'burning', 'peeling', 'redness', '.', 'truthfully', 'think', 'best', 'retinol', 'cream', 'ive', 'ever', 'used', 'thats', 'feels', 'skin', '.', 'lets', 'talk', 'results.usually', 'ads', 'state', 'something', 'like', '95', 'users', 'noticed', 'improvement', 'wrinkles', '7', 'days', 'something', 'along', 'line', '.', 'often', 'wondered', 'respondents', 'trials', 'ever', 'used', 'product', 'many', 'women', 'consistently', 'dont', 'even', 'use', 'face', 'cream', 'yet', 'established', 'habit', 'moisturizing', 'skin', '.', 'not', 'course', 'theyd', 'see', 'incredible', 'results', 'ive', 'taking', 'care', 'skin', 'normal', 'regimen', 'since', 'teens', '.', 'thanks', 'mom', 'said', 'skin', 'pretty', 'acclimated', 'point', 'moisturizers', 'antiwrinkle', 'creams', '.', 'short', 'hard', 'dramatically', 'improve', 'beyond', 'currently', 'use', 'stellar', 'pricey', 'products.this', 'product', 'changed', 'playing', 'field', '.', 'one', 'use', 'could', 'tell', 'different', '.', 'im', 'addicted', 'hard', 'time', 'finishing', 'products', 'people', 'work', 'ask', 'im', 'skin', '.', 'tell', 'super', 'soft', 'supple', 'radiant', 'skin', 'looks', '.', 'thought', 'noticed', 'others', '.', 'dont', 'want', 'waste', 'existing', 'product', 'im', 'going', 'still', 'use', 'first', 'ordering', 'gone', 'ill', 'ordering', 'full', 'time', '.', 'im', 'also', 'going', 'try', 'products', 'well', '.', 'amazing', 'product', '.', 'incredible', 'value', '.', 'beats', '75', 'serum']"

i am 33 had a baby right before i turned 31 prior to that i had cystic type acne all my life that i never grew out of then got acne in places i never had it before when i was pregnant and lets face it growing a baby does stuff to your body some stuff you never come back from and i stayed pretty hormonally imbalanced for a long time. im very fair skinned and every pimple popped or unpopped left a lasting pink scar on my face requiring concealer months long after its official departure. a reminder of the pimple that had beenhad almost been that needed to be hidden as more approached. id used the classic proactiv with the best results for years and years and went right back to that with the same results of its not 100 but its better than everything else. and on top of it i have always had an incredibly oily face and scalp. my mother first suggested something with hyaluronic acid and that was becoming increasingly popular while i was pregnant and was not supposed to use it so i didnt give it another thought. but with my boy about to be turning 2 and my skin still so confused i figured id give it a shot. i read outstanding reviews of this stuff and figured id give it a shot. i got the serum and the retinol moisturizer and got the regular face cream and eye cream in case my skin got dry. i just read a bunch of people talking about how the first week or two you use it it can cause dryness and some peeling so i figured i should have some of the basic stuff too. i dont know if its just that my skin was used to the harshness of benzoyl peroxide on the regular or that im so greasy but i didnt experience any of the dryness redness or irritation that a lot of people report the first couple weeks. and i really went balls to the wall with this and cut the proactiv out completely. scary prospect for me. but no joke just using the serum and the retinol moisturizer every day within a few days my skin calmed down a massive amount. the moisturizer is a little on the heavy side although i used it pretty liberally and is a little heavy for use under makeup if youre heavy handed like me but id still put some on let it soak in awhile and just wipe my face down real quick with a cleansing cloth and it was all good. by the end of the first week id had no new pimples and noticed dramatic lightening in the marks from old pimples along with a generally more even skin tone and my face felt smoother softer calmer and looked it too. i have not turned back. the best part is that my skin is also not as greasy as it was before and i have finally found a moisturizer that doesnt make me break out worse. and my skin just soaks up that serum and that stuff is amazing. this is the best,33 baby right turned 31 prior cystic type acne life never grew got acne places never

this is my second bottle. it goes a long way. it is a very good value for how long it lasts. this has been my first experience with a retinol and my skin has cleared up when i used to get cystic acne its very few and far between and usually when i havent used the retinol for a little while. ive got to get back into it every night every single night. it has no scent whatsoever which is wonderful. ive been using it for a little while now and have noticed that my cystic acne has slowed to a halt. this i have today is the first one since i bought this and it is small. my anesthetist who does my facials has noticed a difference. deep blackheads that could not be removed without causing a flare up of acne have come closer to the surface and have been able to be removed. sometimes ill see one that i had not seen before and its literally to where i can just wipe it off literally or barely put any pressure on it and it comes out. i could not be happier. i use it around my eyes and it does not hurt my sensitive eyes and it does not make my sensitive skin really red. the only thing is i cant put it on every single day i do it every other day or every third day because my cheeks got red and thats the only thing that i had changed. started using it every other day and after a week everything looked back to normal. i had used retina when i was young and it was samples in my mom couldnt afford to take me to the dermatologist because it wasnt covered by medicaid. we were very poor. i never put two and two together to realize that retinol and what i use is a teenager were in the same family. i have had the best skin and i definitely will be repurchasing and ive had at least three of my friends purchase it per my results. im 40 now and more worried about getting wrinkles but the acne benefit has just been a plus. i cant say enough good things about this product. ill have to try some of the other stuff in there line. if you want to reach out to me i do have a youtube channel and i will review this and other products if sent to me. and i give true and honest reviews just like i did here. my face is never looked better. i rarely wear makeup.,second bottle . goes long way .

i have very very dry skin although fortunately im not sensitive to anything except some perfumes.  fortunately the scent in lily ana products is very mild although quite noticeable and doesnt bother me at all  i just finished my first full container jar of this cream and i absolutely love it  it took me two months to use it all since i applied it only at night.  i had tried another retinol cream roc which burned when i put it on my face  i discovered it has salicylic acid in it after i bought it which is awful for dry skin so had to cross that off the list   but with this product i never had even a moments discomfort.  im going to get another container as soon as the budget permits.  it goes on easily my skin absorbs it wonderfully and it may not be making me look years younger but it certainly helps me keep from looking any older  ive also been avoiding the sun for at least 20 years so most people think im in my early 50s although i just turned 65.  its the small wrinkles that give me away i suspect.i only have small beginnings of wrinkles crows feet between my eyebrows and my laugh lines  so far.  since i started really trying to slow down the aging process a few months ago ive tried a lot of different companies products and have repeatedly found the less expensive ones to be as good as  or better than  the name brands my skincare routine is four steps  cleanse tone essenceserum and cream.  i use products from a variety of companies and only use the retinol cream in the evening followed by a mask to hold all that goodness in so it can soak into my face and really do good during the night.  and during the day i of course follow with a sunscreen on my face and arms and legs since i live in florida.  i use the elta md uv clear spf 46 which really is great it uses a clear zinc oxide formula that comes highly recommended so even though its expensive a little goes a long way so it lasts forever.its amazing how much better my skin is looking now that im really taking care of it.  the retinol cream soaks so well into my skin its unnoticeable after a few minutes.  my skin tone has evened out and my face is smooth with my wrinkles definitely diminished.  i realize a retinol cream cant make me look 40 again but if i can look younger than my calendar age ill be very happy  i plan to continue using it as long as amazon sells it  and im also going to try some of the other lily ana products which should be great if they work even half as well as this cream i love this cream,dry skin although fortunately im not sensitive anything except perfumes . fortunately scent lily ana products mild although quite noticeable doesnt bother finished first full container jar cream absolutely love took two months use since applied night . tried another retinol

i started using this product a few months ago when my usual moisturizer was out of stock everywhere. my regular product claimed it contain retinol and hyaluronic acid as wrinkle reducers too. it did nothing like this product did. not only did this product reduce the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. it reduced a keloided scar from a shingles pox left on my forehead right between and above my eyes. i have keloiding when scarred. the scar tissue builds up into heavy bulging knots. within the first two weeks i used this product it melted away that excess tissue build up leaving the scar flat and lightened. a dot of concealer and youd never know i had the scar at all. game changer for me i was selfconscious of this scar for past few years. its just a tiny flaw now. i hope neutrogena never discontinued this product. its lightweight not greasy. fast absorbing. fragrance free. it actually works ,started using product months ago usual moisturizer stock everywhere . regular product claimed contain retinol hyaluronic acid wrinkle reducers . nothing like product . not product reduce fine lines around eyes mouth . reduced keloided scar shingles pox left forehead right eyes . keloiding scarred . scar tissue builds heavy bulging knots . within first two weeks used product melted away excess tissue build leaving scar flat lightened . dot concealer youd never know scar . game changer selfconscious scar past years . tiny flaw . hope neutrogena never discontinued product . lightweight not greasy . fast absorbing . fragrance free . actually works,"['started', 'using', 'product', 'months', 'ago', 'usual', 'moisturizer', 'stock', 'everywhere', '.', 'regular', 'product', 'claimed', 'contain', 'retinol', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'wrinkle', 'reducers', '.', 'nothing', 'like', 'product', '.', 'not', 'product', 'reduce', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', 'mouth', '.', 'reduced', 'keloided', 'scar', 'shingles', 'pox', 'left', 'forehead', 'right', 'eyes', '.', 'keloiding', 'scarred', '.', 'scar', 'tissue', 'builds', 'heavy', 'bulging', 'knots', '.', 'within', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', 'used', 'product', 'melted', 'away', 'excess', 'tissue', 'build', 'leaving', 'scar', 'flat', 'lightened', '.', 'dot', 'concealer', 'youd', 'never', 'know', 'scar', '.', 'game', 'changer', 'selfconscious', 'scar', 'past', 'years', '.', 'tiny', 'flaw', '.', 'hope', 'neutrogena', 'never', 'discontinued', 'product', '.', 'lightweight', 'not', 'greasy', '.', 'fast', 'absorbing', '.', 'fragrance', 'free', '.', 'actually', 'works']"

lets face it we all want to look younger for as long as we can. do these products really work or are we spending a lot of money for little resultsi am 75 years old and bought this cream because i started using neutrogena facial cleanser from the time i was 12 years old. back then my mom told me to never use soap on my face so i never did. i like this cream simply because it moisturizes absorbs quickly into my skin and doesnt have a strong odor. i have tried creams that are so thick they just sit on your face without being absorbed. this cream doesnt do that and it does seem to moisturize my face.  other than that i really dont expect any great rejuvenation of my skin.this cream does include retinol which can cause redness until your skin gets used to it but i havent had a problem with this. retinol may help for as long as it is used but the effects are not lasting. the hyaluronic acid may help with hydration and can also help if retinol causes reddening of the skin.so really what does all of this mean and will this cream help you will it reduce or prevent wrinkles if you have dry skin this cream will likely help to prevent wrinkles and many help to reduce the wrinkles you have that have been caused by dry skin. will this cream magically make all your wrinkles disappear probably not. there is too much dependent on heredity environment lifestyle and diet for any cream to overcome.  no cream will compensate for heredity and what we do to our bodies and no cream will undo damage done. i have included a picture of myself at 75 years of age and also on of my mom when she was 99 years old. yes mom had some wrinkles but not so bad at her age and the only cream i used on her face was a moisturizer.what i am saying here is that the state of your skin condition is determined by multiple factors including hereditary tendencies diet and lifestyle. no cream can compensate for these factors.i hope this review was helpful for you. may be beneficial depending on the condition of your skin.,lets face want look younger long . products really work spending lot money little resultsi 75 years old bought cream started using neutrogena facial cleanser time 12 years old

i bought this almost a year ago because bbw discontinued my favorite sleep lotion from their aromatherapy line. while i still love bbw my only complaint was the price of 6.5 fl oz glass bottle that was also not recyclable. so since the scent was discontinued i decided to do some research and found this. i was swayed by the amazing reviews of this product. i ordered it without any hesitation.  i received it within days. and i was surprised how big the bottle was compared to my favorite lotion. i hoped that i would like it as i would hate for it to go to watse. well its been nearly a year and i used it every night without fail.  i found it to be nongreasy very moisturizing and it absorbs quickly. and lavender scent is sooo nice too not too heavy just right.  i also love the pump but once it gets low as it is very low now  it gets harder to pump.  i just open it and shake it down.  i love this lotion as it relaxes my muscles and helps me fall asleep within an hour. i dont think i will ever go back bbw aromatherapy lotions ever again. this was definitely worth my money. i am just about to order one as i am nearly out trouble sleeping this product is for you,bought almost year ago bbw discontinued favorite sleep lotion aromatherapy line . still love bbw complaint price 6.5 fl oz glass bottle also not recyclable . since scent discontinued decided research found . swayed amazing reviews product . ordered without hesitation . received within days . surprised big bottle compared favorite lotion . hoped would like would hate go watse . well nearly year used every night without fail . found nongreasy moisturizing absorbs quickly . lavender scent sooo nice not heavy right . also love pump gets low low gets harder pump . open shake . love lotion relaxes muscles helps fall asleep within hour . dont think ever go back bbw aromatherapy lotions ever . definitely worth money . order one nearly trouble sleeping product,"['bought', 'almost', 'year', 'ago', 'bbw', 'discontinued', 'favorite', 'sleep', 'lotion', 'aromatherapy', 'line', '.', 'still', 'love', 'bbw', 'complaint', 'price', '6.5', 'fl', 'oz', 'glass', 'bottle', 'also', 'not', 'recyclable', '.', 'since', 'scent', 'discontinued', 'decided', 'research', 'found', '.', 'swayed', 'amazing', 'reviews', 'product', '.', 'ordered', 'without', 'hesitation', '.', 'received', 'within', 'days', '.', 'surprised', 'big', 'bottle', 'compared', 'favorite', 'lotion', '.', 'hoped', 'would', 'like', 'would', 'hate', 'go', 'watse', '.', 'well', 'nearly', 'year', 'used', 'every', 'night', 'without', 'fail', '.', 'found', 'nongreasy', 'moisturizing', 'absorbs', 'quickly', '.', 'lavender', 'scent', 'sooo', 'nice', 'not', 'heavy', 'right', '.', 'also', 'love', 'pump', 'gets', 'low', 'low', 'gets', 'harder', 'pump', '.', 'open', 'shake', '.', 'love', 'lotion', 'relaxes', 'muscles', 'helps', 'fall', 'asleep', 'within', 'hour', '.', 'dont', 'think', 'ever', 'go', 'back', 'bbw', 'aromatherapy', 'lotions', 'ever', '.', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', '.', 'order', 'one', 'nearly', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'product']"

if you use foundation this is might not the product for you.i have rosacea and i love the product but it leaves a film. it isnt visable but if you rub your face after it dries there is a layer that will ball up on your fingers like dead skin. i still highly recommend the moisturizer but not if youre putting foundation on after. if you are careful putting it on and use a good primer then it could work.makeup aside this provides a lot of moisture without being too heavy. i switched from aveenos redness reducer after it was discontinued and id say its at least the same quality. my skin is happy. if you dont wear makeup id give this 5 stars. i broke my habit of touching my face so the film isnt an issue. i use azeliac acid before applying it which is very drying and the moisturizer leaves my skin perfect. i highly recommend it. ,use foundation might not product you.i rosacea love product leaves film . isnt visable rub face dries layer ball fingers like dead skin . still highly recommend moisturizer not youre putting foundation . careful putting use good primer could work.makeup aside provides lot moisture without heavy . switched aveenos redness reducer discontinued id say least quality . skin happy . dont wear makeup id give 5 stars . broke habit touching face film isnt issue . use azeliac acid applying drying moisturizer leaves skin perfect . highly recommend .,"['use', 'foundation', 'might', 'not', 'product', 'you.i', 'rosacea', 'love', 'product', 'leaves', 'film', '.', 'isnt', 'visable', 'rub', 'face', 'dries', 'layer', 'ball', 'fingers', 'like', 'dead', 'skin', '.', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'moisturizer', 'not', 'youre', 'putting', 'foundation', '.', 'careful', 'putting', 'use', 'good', 'primer', 'could', 'work.makeup', 'aside', 'provides', 'lot', 'moisture', 'without', 'heavy', '.', 'switched', 'aveenos', 'redness', 'reducer', 'discontinued', 'id', 'say', 'least', 'quality', '.', 'skin', 'happy', '.', 'dont', 'wear', 'makeup', 'id', 'give', '5', 'stars', '.', 'broke', 'habit', 'touching', 'face', 'film', 'isnt', 'issue', '.', 'use', 'azeliac', 'acid', 'applying', 'drying', 'moisturizer', 'leaves', 'skin', 'perfect', '.', 'highly', 'recommend', '.']"

it takes me a very long time to decide on products especially skin care.  it takes day research reviews comparison and youtube videos. i have tried cerave ponds cetaphil ponds vani cream and others. i have sensitive skin so my options are limited. so far of vanicream was the best but in the winter it left my skin red and itchy. i have oily skin in the summer and im learning that i have combination skin in the winter so the other products didnt work for me anymore. they were too thin and watery. my skin never felt clean.  ive only used this for a few days but so far by feel alone i love it. the downside is that it smells like glue but the scent is not strong or offensive. its to be expected with a semi natural product.  but it is nice and smooth not too thick or too thin like the vanicream and cetaphil. it took off makeup a lot better than the others as well. did not have to double cleanse. i also like the moisturizing effect. my skin feels clea and not heavy. it takes time to see how my skin adjusts to new products so i will give it some time before i make a followup review but so far i give it 4 stars. great price as well especially because u really only need a pea sized amount. i normally ignore products that say that but its very true with this one. it will last me a long time. ,takes long time decide products especially skin care . takes day research reviews comparison youtube videos . tried cerave ponds cetaphil ponds vani cream others . sensitive skin options limited . far vanicream best winter left skin red itchy . oily skin summer im learning combination skin winter products didnt work anymore . thin watery . skin never felt clean . ive used days far feel alone love . downside smells like glue scent not strong offensive . expected semi natural product . nice smooth not thick thin like vanicream cetaphil . took makeup lot better others well . not double cleanse . also like moisturizing effect . skin feels clea not heavy . takes time see skin adjusts new products give time make followup review far give 4 stars . great price well especially u really need pea sized amount . normally ignore products say true one . last long time .,"['takes', 'long', 'time', 'decide', 'products', 'especially', 'skin', 'care', '.', 'takes', 'day', 'research', 'reviews', 'comparison', 'youtube', 'videos', '.', 'tried', 'cerave', 'ponds', 'cetaphil', 'ponds', 'vani', 'cream', 'others', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'options', 'limited', '.', 'far', 'vanicream', 'best', 'winter', 'left', 'skin', 'red', 'itchy', '.', 'oily', 'skin', 'summer', 'im', 'learning', 'combination', 'skin', 'winter', 'products', 'didnt', 'work', 'anymore', '.', 'thin', 'watery', '.', 'skin', 'never', 'felt', 'clean', '.', 'ive', 'used', 'days', 'far', 'feel', 'alone', 'love', '.', 'downside', 'smells', 'like', 'glue', 'scent', 'not', 'strong', 'offensive', '.', 'expected', 'semi', 'natural', 'product', '.', 'nice', 'smooth', 'not', 'thick', 'thin', 'like', 'vanicream', 'cetaphil', '.', 'took', 'makeup', 'lot', 'better', 'others', 'well', '.', 'not', 'double', 'cleanse', '.', 'also', 'like', 'moisturizing', 'effect', '.', 'skin', 'feels', 'clea', 'not', 'heavy', '.', 'takes', 'time', 'see', 'skin', 'adjusts', 'new', 'products', 'give', 'time', 'make', 'followup', 'review', 'far', 'give', '4', 'stars', '.', 'great', 'price', 'well', 'especially', 'u', 'really', 'need', 'pea', 'sized', 'amount', '.', 'normally', 'ignore', 'products', 'say', 'true', 'one', '.', 'last', 'long', 'time', '.']"

i think its great when skin products have many reviews on them. we all have quite different skin. some of us have dry some oily some sensitive some tough. what works well for person a might be awesome for me and horrific for someone else. so while im happy to see that some others find this is just right for them i think its also important for me to chime in and say this is far from great for me.im 45 and have quite sensitive skin. i havent worn makeup in twenty years so its important to me that my skin is healthy and fresh looking. people are seeing just my skin  not layers of cover over it. ive tried all sorts of products over the years to keep my skin healthy. several of my friends recommended this burts bees product to me. for their skin it works great. for me it just doesnt.the skin goes on like a white thick lotion almost like hair conditioner. its more a cream than a foaming substance. i dont mind that  but i do mind that it doesnt then seem to rinse off. it sticks on the face and coats it. maybe im more aware of this since i dont wear makeup or use lotion. i can feel it when something is on my skin. that something is then clogging my pores and such. to me i want a cleanser to clean period. i dont want anything left behind. if i then choose to use a lotion or cream id want to choose that lotion to be the best possible for the situation. i wouldnt want to be stuck with this cleanser still stuck on my face filling in my pores.so im curious for that aspect if others simply dont notice that coating left behind or if they notice and they like it. do they think of this cleanser as a cleanserpluslotion or a cleanserplusprotectantfor me that would be bad enough but it does also cause my skin to tingle and turn red. so whether or not it left that layer on my skin it still would come off my list because of the redface issue.clearly others like the product and thats good for their skin. for my skin this is just not something ill be able to use. i tested it over a period of four months just in case some reactions were temporary but it just keeps happening. so ill be giving the rest away to a friend. leaves waxlike finish and also irritates my face,think great

i do love this product. it does feel nice on the skin and makes the skin feel and look somewhat better. the problem is that when it starts doing well is around the time you run out of product. then you have to purchase again way faster than i think you should have to. this lotion isnt cheap. most of us regular struggling working people cant afford to keep purchasing it. because if you dont continue it then you lose the progress with your skin. however i still have to say overall its a great product i think for the price though it should come in a much bigger container. wish there was more for the money,love product . feel nice skin makes skin feel look somewhat better . problem starts well around time run product . purchase way faster think . lotion isnt cheap . us regular struggling working people cant afford keep purchasing . dont continue lose progress skin . however still say overall great product think price though come much bigger container . wish money,"['love', 'product', '.', 'feel', 'nice', 'skin', 'makes', 'skin', 'feel', 'look', 'somewhat', 'better', '.', 'problem', 'starts', 'well', 'around', 'time', 'run', 'product', '.', 'purchase', 'way', 'faster', 'think', '.', 'lotion', 'isnt', 'cheap', '.', 'us', 'regular', 'struggling', 'working', 'people', 'cant', 'afford', 'keep', 'purchasing', '.', 'dont', 'continue', 'lose', 'progress', 'skin', '.', 'however', 'still', 'say', 'overall', 'great', 'product', 'think', 'price', 'though', 'come', 'much', 'bigger', 'container', '.', 'wish', 'money']"

needless to say any woman over fifty has noticed changes in the texture of her skin. and as she approaches sixty that texture starts to look like a party streamer.like crepe paper  its really a shock when it happens. im 74 so it started happening quite a while ago but for many years it was something i could kind of ignore. i still wore sleeveless tops and id even put some shorts on once in a while. but then things changed and not for the better.  the crepe was becoming so visible that i started wanting to cover up. suddenly i was covering my arms even when the weather was hot.  and the shorts all went in the trash.id see all these commercials on tv.especially those long ones with elaborate explanations of how the products work and of course the before and after pictures that showed a grandmother suddenly looking like her granddaughter.  id be interested and ready to call in an order but my good sense told me to check out the reviews most of which were mixed at best.  plus the products were all quite expensive.then i saw an ad that was short simple and too the point.  i looked for it on amazon and because it was very affordable and because i was familiar with the brand name i decided to try it.the containers not fancy and the fragrance isnt special but believe it or not it actually worksim not saying it erased all the crepieness but it definitely given my skin a smoother appearance. i put it on after showering and my skin just looks smoother.the sagging under my arms is still there but the skin isnt wrinkley and thats a pretty good result.so overall i would recommend this product. its affordable and effective. the results are  permanent but theyre good enough to have me going sleeveless again ,needless say woman fifty noticed changes texture skin . approaches sixty texture starts look like party streamer.like crepe paper really shock happens . im 74 started happening quite ago many years something could kind ignore . still wore sleeveless tops id even put shorts . things changed not better . crepe becoming visible started wanting cover . suddenly covering arms even weather hot . shorts went trash.id see commercials tv.especially long ones elaborate explanations products work course pictures showed grandmother suddenly looking like granddaughter . id interested ready call order good sense told check reviews mixed best . plus products quite expensive.then saw ad short simple point . looked amazon affordable familiar brand name decided try it.the containers not fancy fragrance isnt special believe not actually worksim not saying erased crepieness definitely given skin smoother appearance . put showering skin looks smoother.the sagging arms still skin isnt wrinkley thats pretty good result.so overall would recommend product . affordable effective . results permanent theyre good enough going sleeveless,"['needless', 'say', 'woman', 'fifty', 'noticed', 'changes', 'texture', 'skin', '.', 'approaches', 'sixty', 'texture', 'starts', 'look', 'like', 'party', 'streamer.like', 'crepe', 'paper', 'really', 'shock', 'happens', '.', 'im', '74', 'started', 'happening', 'quite', 'ago', 'many', 'years', 'something', 'could', 'kind', 'ignore', '.', 'still', 'wore', 'sleeveless', 'tops', 'id', 'even', 'put', 'shorts', '.', 'things', 'changed', 'not', 'better', '.', 'crepe', 'becoming', 'visible', 'started', 'wanting', 'cover', '.', 'suddenly', 'covering', 'arms', 'even', 'weather', 'hot', '.', 'shorts', 'went', 'trash.id', 'see', 'commercials', 'tv.especially', 'long', 'ones', 'elaborate', 'explanations', 'products', 'work', 'course', 'pictures', 'showed', 'grandmother', 'suddenly', 'looking', 'like', 'granddaughter', '.', 'id', 'interested', 'ready', 'call', 'order', 'good', 'sense', 'told', 'check', 'reviews', 'mixed', 'best', '.', 'plus', 'products', 'quite', 'expensive.then', 'saw', 'ad', 'short', 'simple', 'point', '.', 'looked', 'amazon', 'affordable', 'familiar', 'brand', 'name', 'decided', 'try', 'it.the', 'containers', 'not', 'fancy', 'fragrance', 'isnt', 'special', 'believe', 'not', 'actually', 'worksim', 'not', 'saying', 'erased', 'crepieness', 'definitely', 'given', 'skin', 'smoother', 'appearance', '.', 'put', 'showering', 'skin', 'looks', 'smoother.the', 'sagging', 'arms', 'still', 'skin', 'isnt', 'wrinkley', 'thats', 'pretty', 'good', 'result.so', 'overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'product', '.', 'affordable', 'effective', '.', 'results', 'permanent', 'theyre', 'good', 'enough', 'going', 'sleeveless']"

ive lost a bunch of weight. i dont know how much since i dont have a scale and avoid doctors but i lost enough that i sprouted a turkey neck and bat wings basically overnight. when my elementary music students started playing with my bat wings i decided it was time to do something about it.initially i was doing face exercises but when i got this i decided to just do the lotion for a while to see how it goes. i apply it under my chin and neck and decolletage as well as my upper arms and shoulders and i figured why not put some on my breasts belly and inner thighs which are also all a bit saggy i use it twice a day but for this month im away from my regular home and so im using a cheap brand vitamin e infused lotion instead because its what i have at my second home and i didnt want to carry this big bottle back and forth.i still notice some turkey neck but it seems to be slowly diminishing. and my bat wings are still there i dont exercise by the way and i know that would help but again they seem to be a bit more toned.i assume that this would be more effective if i had started using it at the beginning of my weightloss. but i wasnt planning to lose weight. i just changed my diet and poof so now ive intentionally tried to stabilize my weight or size rather since i dont know what my weight actually is so that my skin can catch up to my loss. then ill focus more on exercise when i start loosing again. the jurry is still out but i think it might be working. . .,ive lost bunch weight . dont know much since dont scale avoid doctors lost enough sprouted turkey neck bat wings basically overnight . elementary music students started playing bat wings decided time something it.initially face exercises got decided lotion see goes . apply chin neck decolletage well upper arms shoulders figured not put breasts belly inner thighs also bit saggy use twice day month im away regular home im using cheap brand vitamin e infused lotion instead second home didnt want carry big bottle back forth.i still notice turkey neck seems slowly diminishing . bat wings still dont exercise way know would help seem bit toned.i assume would effective started using beginning weightloss . wasnt planning lose weight . changed diet poof ive intentionally tried stabilize weight size rather since dont know weight actually skin catch loss . ill focus exercise start loosing . jurry still think might working . . .,"['ive', 'lost', 'bunch', 'weight', '.', 'dont', 'know', 'much', 'since', 'dont', 'scale', 'avoid', 'doctors', 'lost', 'enough', 'sprouted', 'turkey', 'neck', 'bat', 'wings', 'basically', 'overnight', '.', 'elementary', 'music', 'students', 'started', 'playing', 'bat', 'wings', 'decided', 'time', 'something', 'it.initially', 'face', 'exercises', 'got', 'decided', 'lotion', 'see', 'goes', '.', 'apply', 'chin', 'neck', 'decolletage', 'well', 'upper', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'figured', 'not', 'put', 'breasts', 'belly', 'inner', 'thighs', 'also', 'bit', 'saggy', 'use', 'twice', 'day', 'month', 'im', 'away', 'regular', 'home', 'im', 'using', 'cheap', 'brand', 'vitamin', 'e', 'infused', 'lotion', 'instead', 'second', 'home', 'didnt', 'want', 'carry', 'big', 'bottle', 'back', 'forth.i', 'still', 'notice', 'turkey', 'neck', 'seems', 'slowly', 'diminishing', '.', 'bat', 'wings', 'still', 'dont', 'exercise', 'way', 'know', 'would', 'help', 'seem', 'bit', 'toned.i', 'assume', 'would', 'effective', 'started', 'using', 'beginning', 'weightloss', '.', 'wasnt', 'planning', 'lose', 'weight', '.', 'changed', 'diet', 'poof', 'ive', 'intentionally', 'tried', 'stabilize', 'weight', 'size', 'rather', 'since', 'dont', 'know', 'weight', 'actually', 'skin', 'catch', 'loss', '.', 'ill', 'focus', 'exercise', 'start', 'loosing', '.', 'jurry', 'still', 'think', 'might', 'working', '.', '.', '.']"

for years dove has been my go to for body washes. they smell great and feel good. ive recently been getting into jergens again by using their lotions the scent is so nostalgic to me and i really wanted to test out their body wash. the smell is just as good as the lotion if not better. you can really smell the cherry from the bottle a little bit more than the lotion. the lather is decent not as good as dove but it gets the job done. i had to reapply some more on my loofah but theres a lot in the bottle so its a good price for the size. it does what it says it softened my skin and made it look and feel good but again it didnt glide smoothly or feel as good as dove. its definitely better than those cheap body washes especially the harsh mens ones that i used to use but it just cant beat dove. when i got out of the shower i felt fresh and smelled pretty good definitely more almondy. the lotion on the other hand smells more powdery fresh to me. the lotion feels great super nice smelling and softening. however its at a weird spot for me. it seems like it helped me. but at the same time it didnt. it felt like somedays it just left a film over my skin to give the illusion that it moisturized it. its hard to describe but only the front on my hands the palms felt like they were softsmoother whereas the backs the knuckles felt the same as before i put the lotion on. ive tried the jergens cherry almond mini travel size 3 fl and that one feels like it helped better but i assume the big and small one are the same. ive tried doves hand lotion and i dont like the scent at all but it noticeably moisturized my hands. jergens isnt bad but i think its more about the smell. its such a nostalgic warm and inviting smell but i hope they make it more moisturizing in the future. not as good as dove,years dove go body washes . smell great feel good . ive recently getting jergens using lotions scent nostalgic really wanted test body wash. smell good lotion not better . really smell cherry bottle little bit lotion . lather decent not good dove gets job done . reapply loofah theres lot bottle good price size . says softened skin made look feel good didnt glide smoothly feel good dove . definitely better cheap body washes especially harsh mens ones used use cant beat dove . got shower felt fresh smelled pretty good definitely almondy . lotion hand smells powdery fresh . lotion feels great super nice smelling softening . however weird spot . seems like helped . time didnt . felt like somedays left film skin give illusion moisturized . hard describe front hands palms felt like softsmoother whereas backs knuckles felt put lotion . ive tried jergens cherry almond mini travel size 3 fl one feels like helped better assume big small one . ive tried doves hand lotion dont like scent noticeably moisturized hands . jergens isnt bad think smell . nostalgic warm inviting smell hope make moisturizing future . not good dove,"['years', 'dove', 'go', 'body', 'washes', '.', 'smell', 'great', 'feel', 'good', '.', 'ive', 'recently', 'getting', 'jergens', 'using', 'lotions', 'scent', 'nostalgic', 'really', 'wanted', 'test', 'body', 'wash.', 'smell', 'good', 'lotion', 'not', 'better', '.', 'really', 'smell', 'cherry', 'bottle', 'little', 'bit', 'lotion', '.', 'lather', 'decent', 'not', 'good', 'dove', 'gets', 'job', 'done', '.', 'reapply', 'loofah', 'theres', 'lot', 'bottle', 'good', 'price', 'size', '.', 'says', 'softened', 'skin', 'made', 'look', 'feel', 'good', 'didnt', 'glide', 'smoothly', 'feel', 'good', 'dove', '.', 'definitely', 'better', 'cheap', 'body', 'washes', 'especially', 'harsh', 'mens', 'ones', 'used', 'use', 'cant', 'beat', 'dove', '.', 'got', 'shower', 'felt', 'fresh', 'smelled', 'pretty', 'good', 'definitely', 'almondy', '.', 'lotion', 'hand', 'smells', 'powdery', 'fresh', '.', 'lotion', 'feels', 'great', 'super', 'nice', 'smelling', 'softening', '.', 'however', 'weird', 'spot', '.', 'seems', 'like', 'helped', '.', 'time', 'didnt', '.', 'felt', 'like', 'somedays', 'left', 'film', 'skin', 'give', 'illusion', 'moisturized', '.', 'hard', 'describe', 'front', 'hands', 'palms', 'felt', 'like', 'softsmoother', 'whereas', 'backs', 'knuckles', 'felt', 'put', 'lotion', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'jergens', 'cherry', 'almond', 'mini', 'travel', 'size', '3', 'fl', 'one', 'feels', 'like', 'helped', 'better', 'assume', 'big', 'small', 'one', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'doves', 'hand', 'lotion', 'dont', 'like', 'scent', 'noticeably', 'moisturized', 'hands', '.', 'jergens', 'isnt', 'bad', 'think', 'smell', '.', 'nostalgic', 'warm', 'inviting', 'smell', 'hope', 'make', 'moisturizing', 'future', '.', 'not', 'good', 'dove']"

whenever im going to a doctors office or to any place where people who might be sensitive to fragrances may be like around cancer patients going through treatment i seek to use products that are fragrancefree like this lotion.  i also like the aveeno lotion with ylangylang but for now lets talk about the scentfree version.it glides on smoothly and is softening not sticky.  for me a good test of the balance of emolliency is whether you can ready snap your fingers and hear the sound after youre done putting on lotion.  if you cant the texture is too greasy oily or thick.  with this lotion the snap test works successfully.  that allows my skin to feel moisturized while not clogged with too much product.the reason for taking off a star is that as it gets toward the end of the bottle it tends to become thickened to the point where it just wants to stick to itself and not readily dispense from the bottle.  ive tried the trick of loosening the lid with the pump striking the bottle on the counter to force some consolidation of the contents to be able to get more to flow out.  that sortof works for a while.it seems to end up with several inches of lotion sticking to the container instead of dispensing.  im now storing the end of the last bottle upside down in hopes of being able to use more of the lotion before its time to move on to the new one.overall this performs like a good quality lotion at a reasonable price. provides moisture  no fragrance,whenever im going doctors office place people might sensitive fragrances may like around cancer patients going treatment seek use products fragrancefree like lotion . also like aveeno lotion ylangylang lets talk scentfree version.it glides smoothly softening not sticky . good test balance emolliency whether ready snap fingers hear sound youre done putting lotion . cant texture greasy oily thick . lotion snap test works successfully . allows skin feel moisturized not clogged much product.the reason taking star gets toward end bottle tends become thickened point wants stick not readily dispense bottle . ive tried trick loosening lid pump striking bottle counter force consolidation contents able get flow . sortof works while.it seems end several inches lotion sticking container instead dispensing . im storing end last bottle upside hopes able use lotion time move new one.overall performs like good quality lotion reasonable price . provides moisture no fragrance,"['whenever', 'im', 'going', 'doctors', 'office', 'place', 'people', 'might', 'sensitive', 'fragrances', 'may', 'like', 'around', 'cancer', 'patients', 'going', 'treatment', 'seek', 'use', 'products', 'fragrancefree', 'like', 'lotion', '.', 'also', 'like', 'aveeno', 'lotion', 'ylangylang', 'lets', 'talk', 'scentfree', 'version.it', 'glides', 'smoothly', 'softening', 'not', 'sticky', '.', 'good', 'test', 'balance', 'emolliency', 'whether', 'ready', 'snap', 'fingers', 'hear', 'sound', 'youre', 'done', 'putting', 'lotion', '.', 'cant', 'texture', 'greasy', 'oily', 'thick', '.', 'lotion', 'snap', 'test', 'works', 'successfully', '.', 'allows', 'skin', 'feel', 'moisturized', 'not', 'clogged', 'much', 'product.the', 'reason', 'taking', 'star', 'gets', 'toward', 'end', 'bottle', 'tends', 'become', 'thickened', 'point', 'wants', 'stick', 'not', 'readily', 'dispense', 'bottle', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'trick', 'loosening', 'lid', 'pump', 'striking', 'bottle', 'counter', 'force', 'consolidation', 'contents', 'able', 'get', 'flow', '.', 'sortof', 'works', 'while.it', 'seems', 'end', 'several', 'inches', 'lotion', 'sticking', 'container', 'instead', 'dispensing', '.', 'im', 'storing', 'end', 'last', 'bottle', 'upside', 'hopes', 'able', 'use', 'lotion', 'time', 'move', 'new', 'one.overall', 'performs', 'like', 'good', 'quality', 'lotion', 'reasonable', 'price', '.', 'provides', 'moisture', 'no', 'fragrance']"

i have now been using this for over a month. heres what i thinkpros nice feel absorbs quickly. a little goes a long way. good price for the amount of product you get. seeing some results on my chest. i am a lifelong side sleeper despite my best efforts and always wake up with deep wrinkles etched into my chest. using this on my chest morning and night for the last month the wrinkles are softer and disappear sooner.cons no results on crepey skin. my crepey skin areas look exactly the same as before starting this. fragrance is unpleasant. very cloying. sort of powdery old lady smelling if you know i mean no insult meant to any of us old ladies. not unscented as shown in the description and very unappealing on top of that.  if fragrancefree or a pretty scent is important to you  do not get this cream. dispenser is lame. short wide container with a pump in the middle. basically before every single use you need to beat the bottom on the base of your hand or on the counter to knock the product down into the bottom of the container in order to make the pump work. not a dealbreaker but annoying. sometimes i just take the lid off and use my fingers.overall the results on my chest make this something i will probably continue to use especially because it is a decent price. at least until i find something that works as well or better without the above cons.your mileage may vary. updated review some good results good price unpleasant fragrance,using month . heres thinkpros nice feel absorbs quickly . little goes long way . good price amount product get . seeing results chest . lifelong side sleeper despite best efforts always wake deep wrinkles etched chest . using chest morning night last month wrinkles softer disappear sooner.cons no results crepey skin . crepey skin areas look exactly starting . fragrance unpleasant . cloying . sort powdery old lady smelling know mean no insult meant us old ladies . not unscented shown description unappealing top . fragrancefree pretty scent important not get cream . dispenser lame . short wide container pump middle . basically every single use need beat bottom base hand counter knock product bottom container order make pump work . not dealbreaker annoying . sometimes take lid use fingers.overall results chest make something probably continue use especially decent price . least find something works well better without cons.your mileage may vary . updated review good results good price unpleasant fragrance,"['using', 'month', '.', 'heres', 'thinkpros', 'nice', 'feel', 'absorbs', 'quickly', '.', 'little', 'goes', 'long', 'way', '.', 'good', 'price', 'amount', 'product', 'get', '.', 'seeing', 'results', 'chest', '.', 'lifelong', 'side', 'sleeper', 'despite', 'best', 'efforts', 'always', 'wake', 'deep', 'wrinkles', 'etched', 'chest', '.', 'using', 'chest', 'morning', 'night', 'last', 'month', 'wrinkles', 'softer', 'disappear', 'sooner.cons', 'no', 'results', 'crepey', 'skin', '.', 'crepey', 'skin', 'areas', 'look', 'exactly', 'starting', '.', 'fragrance', 'unpleasant', '.', 'cloying', '.', 'sort', 'powdery', 'old', 'lady', 'smelling', 'know', 'mean', 'no', 'insult', 'meant', 'us', 'old', 'ladies', '.', 'not', 'unscented', 'shown', 'description', 'unappealing', 'top', '.', 'fragrancefree', 'pretty', 'scent', 'important', 'not', 'get', 'cream', '.', 'dispenser', 'lame', '.', 'short', 'wide', 'container', 'pump', 'middle', '.', 'basically', 'every', 'single', 'use', 'need', 'beat', 'bottom', 'base', 'hand', 'counter', 'knock', 'product', 'bottom', 'container', 'order', 'make', 'pump', 'work', '.', 'not', 'dealbreaker', 'annoying', '.', 'sometimes', 'take', 'lid', 'use', 'fingers.overall', 'results', 'chest', 'make', 'something', 'probably', 'continue', 'use', 'especially', 'decent', 'price', '.', 'least', 'find', 'something', 'works', 'well', 'better', 'without', 'cons.your', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', '.', 'updated', 'review', 'good', 'results', 'good', 'price', 'unpleasant', 'fragrance']"

i consider myself a beauty product junkieexpert.  you name it ive tried it.  i have done my research ive read medical journals and ive talked to different doctors over the years.  i know about skin care and what does and doesnt work. my hobby is studying nutrition fitness and beauty products.  there isnt a product out there that you can apply topically that is going to cure your skin issues overnight.  but if the product has the right ingredients you will get results you just have to be patient.  this product has the right ingredients. always look at the ingredient list on skincare products.  it is full of butters and one of the first ingredients listed are the retinol and the ferulic acid.  that means that there is a higher concentration of these ingredients in the product and they are not secondary ingredients that wont get you real results.  if the magic ingredient in your product is one of the last things listed its going to do virtually nothing for your skin.  most drug store prodcuts fall into this category.  also this lotion is not going to ultra moisturize your skin topically.  youre going to think that its not working because you wont have that lotiony feel after you put it on.  it quickly soaks in. many people think that if their skin doesnt feel silky slimy and soft right after applying their lotion that the product isnt moisturizing enough.  there is a difference in moisturizing and hydrating.  what you really want is hydration.  this is where the skin attracts moisture in the deeper layers and is locked in from within.  not sitting on top.  lotions that contain mainly butters are hydrating.  thats where youre going to see real results.  most lotions sold in stores moisturize topically.  they contain petrolatum and mineral oil as their main ingredients.  you feel all silky and soft at first but after those lotions soak in or rub off on your clothes beacause they really dont get down below the surface of your skin your skin feels dry again a couple hours later.  this lotion is not like that.  its going to hydrate your skin with treatment not superficial oils and chemical emollients.  as far as the smell it doesnt bother me but i can see why some might not like it.  what youre smelling is the shea butter which to many people has a kind of cocoaish baby powderish kind of smell.  some people even say they smell kind of a hint of rose.  shea butter naturally smells like all this.  thats a good thing bc its the main ingredient in the lotion.  if you dont like the smell then dont buy any products that contain mainly shea butter.  overall this is a great product.  i have been using it for about a month and i can tell a difference in the quality of my skin.  texture tone firmness etc.  it is not going to magically erase age spots or sun spots.  you would have to use pure vitamin c or a bleaching cream containing hydroquinone to topically reduce the appearance those.  if you really want to get rid of those youd have to break the bank to get them laser treated.  for a topical hydration and mild antiaging treatment this lotion  does work if you use it long enough but set realistic expectations. excellent product but

i just purchased the st. ives collagen  elastin moisturizer and this is my first try with this product. i am unable to tell how it is on sensitive skin or if it truly a good moisturizer bc i just got it  still trying it out. it does seem to be a decent moisturizer with pleasant clean scent without a lingering smell.i have used this brand for a while for hair and body lotions but find this much thinner than the bodylotion ive used before. i do hope this is as good as the many people stated but found one commentthat the company is not the same manufacturer of st. ives product. this is true. i have only used it for 2 days  i read some people had bad reactions although for me im o.k. i also called the companyto find out why there was no protected plastic cover or safety ring around the jar and i was told by the rep. that  it was due to the new companys  safe way to help the environment by using less plastic just as stores are using more paper bags and people using more glass bottles than plastic so  o.k. i got it. hope this info helps. its a gamble when good product companies are sold to other companies that cut corners even on their ingredients. anyway so far my skin is not having a problem with this moisturizeralso i have never had a problem nor had dry skin but as a senior i need to start a better skin care routine. i will update later if it is good or not honestly. it seems to be a decent moisturizer .no plastic seal used to save environment.,purchased st. ives collagen elastin moisturizer first try product . unable tell sensitive skin truly good moisturizer bc got still trying . seem decent moisturizer pleasant clean scent without lingering smell.i used brand hair body lotions find much thinner bodylotion ive used . hope good many people stated found one commentthat company not manufacturer st. ives product . true . used 2 days read people bad reactions although im o.k . also called companyto find no protected plastic cover safety ring around jar told rep. due new companys safe way help environment using less plastic stores using paper bags people using glass bottles plastic o.k . got . hope info helps . gamble good product companies sold companies cut corners even ingredients . anyway far skin not problem moisturizeralso never problem nor dry skin senior need start better skin care routine . update later good not honestly . seems decent moisturizer .no plastic seal used save environment .,"['purchased', 'st.', 'ives', 'collagen', 'elastin', 'moisturizer', 'first', 'try', 'product', '.', 'unable', 'tell', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'truly', 'good', 'moisturizer', 'bc', 'got', 'still', 'trying', '.', 'seem', 'decent', 'moisturizer', 'pleasant', 'clean', 'scent', 'without', 'lingering', 'smell.i', 'used', 'brand', 'hair', 'body', 'lotions', 'find', 'much', 'thinner', 'bodylotion', 'ive', 'used', '.', 'hope', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'stated', 'found', 'one', 'commentthat', 'company', 'not', 'manufacturer', 'st.', 'ives', 'product', '.', 'true', '.', 'used', '2', 'days', 'read', 'people', 'bad', 'reactions', 'although', 'im', 'o.k', '.', 'also', 'called', 'companyto', 'find', 'no', 'protected', 'plastic', 'cover', 'safety', 'ring', 'around', 'jar', 'told', 'rep.', 'due', 'new', 'companys', 'safe', 'way', 'help', 'environment', 'using', 'less', 'plastic', 'stores', 'using', 'paper', 'bags', 'people', 'using', 'glass', 'bottles', 'plastic', 'o.k', '.', 'got', '.', 'hope', 'info', 'helps', '.', 'gamble', 'good', 'product', 'companies', 'sold', 'companies', 'cut', 'corners', 'even', 'ingredients', '.', 'anyway', 'far', 'skin', 'not', 'problem', 'moisturizeralso', 'never', 'problem', 'nor', 'dry', 'skin', 'senior', 'need', 'start', 'better', 'skin', 'care', 'routine', '.', 'update', 'later', 'good', 'not', 'honestly', '.', 'seems', 'decent', 'moisturizer', '.no', 'plastic', 'seal', 'used', 'save', 'environment', '.']"

caucasian scotchirish  sicilian female here and i have horribly dry and tempermentalsensitivie skin due to a plethora of inflammatory immune system issues and it has gotten even worse when im on chemotherapy and this lotion is by far the best ive come across.when im on chemo andor in a bad flare up my skin even gets so bad that when it comes in prolonged contact with water i.e. showering.forget baths it feels like my skin is on fire. by faaaaar this lotion has done the best job of calming down the burningitching after showers.i also have pretty significant keratosis pilaris the red pinprick permanent rash looking thing also referred to as chicken skin on my legs and arms. and while this does not get rid of it honestly ive yet to find anything that really does even expensive prescription ones it does calm it downmake it less bright red and less noticable.it smells great. light fresh and clean. and if you choose to wear perfume it doesnt interact poorlyoverwhelm the scent with it.easy to pump onto hand. it feels very smooth and silky not slimy or sticky.if you use a lot of it like i tend to in order to best counteract dryness i.e. like 1 full pump per arm 2 full pumps per leg it does take a bit to fully rub it in so you can no longer see it. but if you dont mind the slight white look on top of your skin you can lightly rub it in and then your skin should absorb it within 10ish minutes tops and no longer be noticable.ive also used it while my skin is still wet and while my skin is dry to touch and it works well both ways. only issue with doing it while wet is it will feel slick and slippery until your skin dries. buy i do find it applies a little easier when wet and ive heard it is better for skin absorption to use lotion while your skin is still wet too.im definitely hooked for life. especially with the price. most creams and lotions that are needed to combat the level of dryness and sensitivity that i have normally are super pricey and many smell kinda gross and have a weird texturesfeeling on the skin.definitely a must for sensitive dry skin. but still great for any skin. my mother doesnt have skin issues and she also loves this lotion.

i have a very oily tzone and was looking for a water cream that wasnt too thick but would still moisturize enough. previously i had been using very thick creams to moisturize the dry areas of my face my cheeks but that just made my tzone overproduce oil to the point where you could see it bead up fifteen minutes after my morning routine. i used this cream for around 2 weeks and i would say that it did what i wanted for the most part. it definitely kept my tzone happy and not overproducing oil while at the same time keeping my cheeks moisturized. also unscented which is very hard to find.however it didnt take long for me to notice there was a strange texture over my skin a few hours after use. when i ran my hands over my face it would feel dry to my hands that raspy kind of feel but my face didnt actually feel dry. when it became hotter and i had to reapply my sunscreen is when i realized that raspy feel was due to a film that this cream leaves behind. when reapplying my sunscreen the film would roll up underneath kind of like dead skin does when you scrub with those korean spa cloths. this is pretty much the only con that the film it leaves makes it impossible to layer on top after the cream has driedabsorbed into the skin. i will use the remainer i have left at night time when reapplying suncreen on top is not an issue. ,oily tzone looking water cream wasnt thick would still moisturize enough . previously using thick creams moisturize dry areas face cheeks made tzone overproduce oil point could see bead fifteen minutes morning routine . used cream around 2 weeks would say wanted part . definitely kept tzone happy not overproducing oil time keeping cheeks moisturized . also unscented hard find.however didnt take long notice strange texture skin hours use . ran hands face would feel dry hands raspy kind feel face didnt actually feel dry . became hotter reapply sunscreen realized raspy feel due film cream leaves behind . reapplying sunscreen film would roll underneath kind like dead skin scrub korean spa cloths . pretty much con film leaves makes impossible layer top cream driedabsorbed skin . use remainer left night time reapplying suncreen top not issue .,"['oily', 'tzone', 'looking', 'water', 'cream', 'wasnt', 'thick', 'would', 'still', 'moisturize', 'enough', '.', 'previously', 'using', 'thick', 'creams', 'moisturize', 'dry', 'areas', 'face', 'cheeks', 'made', 'tzone', 'overproduce', 'oil', 'point', 'could', 'see', 'bead', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'morning', 'routine', '.', 'used', 'cream', 'around', '2', 'weeks', 'would', 'say', 'wanted', 'part', '.', 'definitely', 'kept', 'tzone', 'happy', 'not', 'overproducing', 'oil', 'time', 'keeping', 'cheeks', 'moisturized', '.', 'also', 'unscented', 'hard', 'find.however', 'didnt', 'take', 'long', 'notice', 'strange', 'texture', 'skin', 'hours', 'use', '.', 'ran', 'hands', 'face', 'would', 'feel', 'dry', 'hands', 'raspy', 'kind', 'feel', 'face', 'didnt', 'actually', 'feel', 'dry', '.', 'became', 'hotter', 'reapply', 'sunscreen', 'realized', 'raspy', 'feel', 'due', 'film', 'cream', 'leaves', 'behind', '.', 'reapplying', 'sunscreen', 'film', 'would', 'roll', 'underneath', 'kind', 'like', 'dead', 'skin', 'scrub', 'korean', 'spa', 'cloths', '.', 'pretty', 'much', 'con', 'film', 'leaves', 'makes', 'impossible', 'layer', 'top', 'cream', 'driedabsorbed', 'skin', '.', 'use', 'remainer', 'left', 'night', 'time', 'reapplying', 'suncreen', 'top', 'not', 'issue', '.']"

this is the third time ive tried lotion from this company. ive tried a collagen one and and retinol one. that was 4 years ago and one thing i noticed was that they dont really absorb well. there is a white cast and you have to rub over and over and over.i was looking for a rose scented lotion because i love true rose scented items and this came up. it had great reviews so i decided to give this brand another shot. its the same thing it doesnt rub in as well as other brands that i like. people seem to love it though but this is my take on it. i dont love it. i dont hate it but its not a favorite. the scent is nice enough. i prefer more of a true rose scent. i hate grandma type rose scents and this is almost like that but its not so bad that i hate it. i will use it up and probably not order it again. the quest continues. ,third time ive tried lotion company . ive tried collagen one retinol one . 4 years ago one thing noticed dont really absorb well . white cast rub over.i looking rose scented lotion love true rose scented items came . great reviews decided give brand another shot . thing doesnt rub well brands like . people seem love though take . dont love . dont hate not favorite . scent nice enough . prefer true rose scent . hate grandma type rose scents almost like not bad hate . use probably not order . quest continues .,"['third', 'time', 'ive', 'tried', 'lotion', 'company', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'collagen', 'one', 'retinol', 'one', '.', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'thing', 'noticed', 'dont', 'really', 'absorb', 'well', '.', 'white', 'cast', 'rub', 'over.i', 'looking', 'rose', 'scented', 'lotion', 'love', 'true', 'rose', 'scented', 'items', 'came', '.', 'great', 'reviews', 'decided', 'give', 'brand', 'another', 'shot', '.', 'thing', 'doesnt', 'rub', 'well', 'brands', 'like', '.', 'people', 'seem', 'love', 'though', 'take', '.', 'dont', 'love', '.', 'dont', 'hate', 'not', 'favorite', '.', 'scent', 'nice', 'enough', '.', 'prefer', 'true', 'rose', 'scent', '.', 'hate', 'grandma', 'type', 'rose', 'scents', 'almost', 'like', 'not', 'bad', 'hate', '.', 'use', 'probably', 'not', 'order', '.', 'quest', 'continues', '.']"

so youve read the title and must be wondering that deserves three stars well thats because i liked this product initially but thats because when i bought this product over a year ago i was a beginner skincare girlie and bought this sunscreen thinking it was a moisturizer for two weeks after i bought it and up until a week ago i had no idea i was using this wrong. i was only applying about a pea amount on my cheeks and forehead but in reality in order to actually get protection from the spf i needed to apply two fingers worth. at first i thought this sunscreen felt heavy and gave a slight white cast when applied on top of skincare steps on its own on completely bare skin there wasnt a cast so if you dont have a skincare routine if this product should be fine for you but since i was applying such a small amount and if i massaged it into my skin enough eventually it didnt feel like anything. so today i finally applied this sunscreen the proper way. and lord that heavy and white cast feel was multiplied so much. i have combination skin and my face was shining brighter than the sun even after massaging the sunscreen into my skin as much as possible and giving it 15 minutes to absorb. even then my face looked so oily the united states army could invade my face to take it. even the dry sandy parts of my face looked oily as hell and thats not moisturizing its just drowning your pores. i have light skin too and since it gives a bad white cast on my ghost skin this product definitely isnt for my dark skinned girlies out there. be minded this isnt because i messed up the skincare steps prior im now seasoned in this skincare thing and i gave each step time to absorb applied the right amount to the right areas of my face pat my skin with my hands etc etc. and even then this sunscreen made my face look and feel heavy and oily as hell. it also says in the product description that it isnt waterproof and since its hot as hell where i live atm the sunscreen practically melted off my face in minutes so it defeated the whole using the proper amount of product thing if my face is getting baked anyway in the end. im giving it three stars because i liked the product for the first year i used this despite using it incorrectly but after using the amount i shouldve been using all this time dear lord is this product the worst. the only exception i can think to buying this is if you dont wear makeup or need that much moisturization for your skin so you dont need to wear anything but sunscreen. but for everyone else youre better off investing in korean skincare for better quality and cheaper prices. im glad little old 2022 me liked this product though even though i was using it incorrectly the whole time and it was likely it wasnt doing ass to protect my face from the suns cancerinducing rays. peace yall. white cast heavy on the face makes skin look oily,youve read title must wondering deserves three stars well thats liked product initially thats bought
