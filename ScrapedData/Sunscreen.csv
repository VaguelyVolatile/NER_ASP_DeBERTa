i really love this stuff.  second time buying it and it lasts forever.  i use it instead of foundation.  i like the high spf and it feels really good to put on then dries down to a matte finish but so smooth like your skin.  you can barely feel it.  and i think my face is in better condition since using it.  usually im very sensitive to spf it often makes me break out but not this one.  the only downside is shade range i have the lightest its still slightly darker than my natural color but not a deal breaker.  probably just gives me a little more color.  it also keeps me from getting greasy throughout the day which is cool because im really oily. ,really love stuff . second time buying lasts forever . use instead foundation . like high spf feels really good put dries matte finish smooth like skin . barely feel . think face better condition since using . usually im sensitive spf often makes break not one . downside shade range lightest still slightly darker natural color not deal breaker . probably gives little color . also keeps getting greasy throughout day cool im really oily .,"['really', 'love', 'stuff', '.', 'second', 'time', 'buying', 'lasts', 'forever', '.', 'use', 'instead', 'foundation', '.', 'like', 'high', 'spf', 'feels', 'really', 'good', 'put', 'dries', 'matte', 'finish', 'smooth', 'like', 'skin', '.', 'barely', 'feel', '.', 'think', 'face', 'better', 'condition', 'since', 'using', '.', 'usually', 'im', 'sensitive', 'spf', 'often', 'makes', 'break', 'not', 'one', '.', 'downside', 'shade', 'range', 'lightest', 'still', 'slightly', 'darker', 'natural', 'color', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', '.', 'probably', 'gives', 'little', 'color', '.', 'also', 'keeps', 'getting', 'greasy', 'throughout', 'day', 'cool', 'im', 'really', 'oily', '.']"
i will say the tint is almost laughable but the way it makes my skin look is great. i use tinted sunscreens to combat the white cast of the zinc i wear daily i work outside so layers of sunscreen matter a lot to me but i cant say this one helps with that. its definitely tinted but not nearly enough.it does add a smoothed filter finish to my skin that makes me look almost pore less and everyone at work has been talking about how i appear to be glowing as of late. its certainly dewy finish so if you dont like that consider using a powder on top.its a great product overall and i do recommend if for the no makeup makeup look because its almost undetectable definitely going to buy more once i run out. ,say tint almost laughable way makes skin look great . use tinted sunscreens combat white cast zinc wear daily work outside layers sunscreen matter lot cant say one helps . definitely tinted not nearly enough.it add smoothed filter finish skin makes look almost pore less everyone work talking appear glowing late . certainly dewy finish dont like consider using powder top.its great product overall recommend no makeup makeup look almost undetectable definitely going buy run .,"['say', 'tint', 'almost', 'laughable', 'way', 'makes', 'skin', 'look', 'great', '.', 'use', 'tinted', 'sunscreens', 'combat', 'white', 'cast', 'zinc', 'wear', 'daily', 'work', 'outside', 'layers', 'sunscreen', 'matter', 'lot', 'cant', 'say', 'one', 'helps', '.', 'definitely', 'tinted', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough.it', 'add', 'smoothed', 'filter', 'finish', 'skin', 'makes', 'look', 'almost', 'pore', 'less', 'everyone', 'work', 'talking', 'appear', 'glowing', 'late', '.', 'certainly', 'dewy', 'finish', 'dont', 'like', 'consider', 'using', 'powder', 'top.its', 'great', 'product', 'overall', 'recommend', 'no', 'makeup', 'makeup', 'look', 'almost', 'undetectable', 'definitely', 'going', 'buy', 'run', '.']"

i was very curious about this product because it is recommended by amazon and on numerous sites as a hg tinted mineral sunscreen. the price is incredibly affordable and the formula is amazing. but it didnt work out for me when searching for a mineral face sunscreen here on amazon this product was always popping up. i did see more reviews on my dad the chemist and angies hot and flashy utube video which piqued my interest. the research done by the company to claim its high spf and ppd rating they used european standards to test which is better than us. all around sterling protection factor spf 50 and ppd of 19.2 that is more than pa. i need sunscreen to protect my skin from hyperpigmentation and dark spots as i am entering my 5th decade and unhappy with the consequence of tanning beds and sunbathing in my youth. i am waging war with uv rays and im determined to win.the product is priced from 1016 which makes it very affordable considering its a generous 3 oz tube. its available here on amazon as well as us drugstores. it is made in us despite the name australian gold.the formula is ultra matte and not sticky at all. it blurs fine lines and wrinkles with the tint coverage enough to smooth complexion but not too heavy when applied thickly as sunscreens require 14 teaspoon for face alone. it is light as a feather and super easy to spread. it appears darker out of the tube but it lightens up upon application. dries in reasonable time approx 15 or less mins which is better than some formulas which take ages to dry and sticky at best. the color is neutral as i have a neutral undertone and medium i am mac nc 30 in the summer in the winter i am mac nw 25 as i get golden yellow when i tanits a unicorn of a product matte not greasy no white cast at all and works as a primer and gives a finished lowmaintenance makeup free kind of look. everything you would want in a mineral sunscreen for those who care about absorption of nasty chemicals that is cosmetically elegant and has high sun protective qualities.why did this not work for me it makes me look paperydry even with a few drops of squalene oil and hyaluronic essence cosrx as others had advised if you are not oily complexion. my face looks great until i smile or raise my eyebrows as the depth of the lines are accentuated with emotion. crows feet at sides of eyes multiply and deepen. tis ages me 10 years. if i have a stoic face it looks beautiful but as soon as i smile or frown or make any expression its creepy.in addition it is very difficult to remove. i am used to natural formulas with beeswax and those are hard to get off but this one is up there with japanese milk formulas. youre going to need to double cleanse with an oil or balm first i use jojoba or virgin coconut oil and then a regular foaming cleanser or bar soap on some kind of cloth or scrubber i use makeup eraser cloth or a micro fiber cloth. its too much for my sensitivethinning  50 year old skin can handle. pulling and tugging i am raw from the experience.if you have oily skin younger and at the beach or in a situation where things slide off your face as soon as you sweat this is for you. outdoor activities exercising or running in the summer heat or a day at the beach or amusement park this is for you. as a daily sunscreen its a bit tenacious of a formula. great product but with caveats,curious product recommended amazon

last time we took a cruise through the caribbean we burnt that first time we laid out in the sun. this time around i read reviews but was also looking for a sunscreen that was approved for certain places in the caribbean due to the ingredients. i saw sun bum recommended by a cruiser on our facebook group so we purchased to give it a try.we are not sun worshippers so we only needed a sunscreen that could keep us from burning in about 1 1.5 hours of sun time. this was fantastic for that without having to reapply also the smell was great. i dont love many sunscreen smells out there but this was definitely pleasant. we used it regularly on our 7day cruise and still brought some home. we spent time in the sun probably 5 of those 7 days and didnt burn at all. highly recommend and will definitely purchase again both for cruising and the summertime at our local pool which is nowhere near the strength of the sun in the caribbean. worked well  no sunburns,last time took cruise caribbean burnt first time laid sun . time around read reviews also looking sunscreen approved certain places caribbean due ingredients . saw sun bum recommended cruiser facebook group purchased give try.we not sun worshippers needed sunscreen could keep us burning 1 1.5 hours sun time . fantastic without reapply also smell great . dont love many sunscreen smells definitely pleasant . used regularly 7day cruise still brought home . spent time sun probably 5 7 days didnt burn . highly recommend definitely purchase cruising summertime local pool nowhere near strength sun caribbean . worked well no sunburns,"['last', 'time', 'took', 'cruise', 'caribbean', 'burnt', 'first', 'time', 'laid', 'sun', '.', 'time', 'around', 'read', 'reviews', 'also', 'looking', 'sunscreen', 'approved', 'certain', 'places', 'caribbean', 'due', 'ingredients', '.', 'saw', 'sun', 'bum', 'recommended', 'cruiser', 'facebook', 'group', 'purchased', 'give', 'try.we', 'not', 'sun', 'worshippers', 'needed', 'sunscreen', 'could', 'keep', 'us', 'burning', '1', '1.5', 'hours', 'sun', 'time', '.', 'fantastic', 'without', 'reapply', 'also', 'smell', 'great', '.', 'dont', 'love', 'many', 'sunscreen', 'smells', 'definitely', 'pleasant', '.', 'used', 'regularly', '7day', 'cruise', 'still', 'brought', 'home', '.', 'spent', 'time', 'sun', 'probably', '5', '7', 'days', 'didnt', 'burn', '.', 'highly', 'recommend', 'definitely', 'purchase', 'cruising', 'summertime', 'local', 'pool', 'nowhere', 'near', 'strength', 'sun', 'caribbean', '.', 'worked', 'well', 'no', 'sunburns']"

i will start by saying that i am used to traditional nonmineral sunscreens and tend to only buy physicalmineralbased sunscreens when im going to be in a tropical ocean and need something reefsafe though more and more kids sunscreens are shifting to mineralbased. after quite a bit of research i settled on thinksport for my familys recent trip to hawaii and im very pleased with it. i brought and used three types of thinksport sunscreen thinksport kids lotion yelloworange and teal squeeze bottle thinksport adult lotion black white and orange squeeze bottle and thinksport adult spray black white and orange spray bottle. all protected us from sunburn and rubbed in to be invisible as long as skin was dry and free of visible hair visible whiteness persisted around my husbands facial stubble and chest hair.  the only difference between the kids lotion versus the adult lotion is scentthe kids version has a fruitier more tropical but nottoostrong scent possibly coconut and something else it was hard to identify that i found unobjectionable though one if my kids wasnt a fan and the adult lotion had a lighter less sweet more citrusy scent my son though maybe lime and mint but im not sure thats accurate that i love. the adult spray had no discernible scent so i suspect the kids spray might be fairly unscented as well. the easiest to apply by far was the sprayit sprays on white but feels very light rubs in easily and becomes invisible quickly. i was a little worried about whether it could possibly be effective given how light and thin it felt but it was  the lotions werent thick for a lotion but much thicker than the spray and went on easily but took more rubbing in to disappear than the spray this is consistent with my experience with lotion vs spray in traditional sunscreens as well. invisibility was harder to get after a second or third application or when skin was damp but allinall i found all three thinksport products to be superior to other mineralbased sunscreens i have tried in the past. in the future ill probably buy the adult thinksport spray for my kids and husband who all much prefer a sprayon sunscreen and the adult thinksport lotion for myself because i love the scent and dont mind rubbing it in. great reefsafe easytoapply sunscreen comparison of three thinksport products,start saying used traditional nonmineral sunscreens tend buy

i love intellishade. my dermatologist client sent me a sample of this very tube a year ago and what i love most is the combination of the fact that it is 45 spf not 10 or 15 spf which is the ridiculous but standard spf on most face moisturizers and it is tinted with just enough foundation tone that you do not need to apply foundation. protecting your skin from the sun is crucial and yet you dont have to give in to those greasy sunscreen lotions.so this is my second bottle even if the price is outside my comfort level i feel that it is entirely worth it. the product quality is very high and the ingredients are approved and endorsed by my dermatologist friend so i trust them. my skin loves this product. it is a wee bit oily and i have normal skin but it applies very nicely and gives your skin the silky smooth effect. i then add an organic mineral powder foundation and a little blush and im donelove love intellishade and happy to see that it is available on amazon its the best compromise between wearing enough sunscreen to protect your pretty face from sun damage and still looking great  fantastic product and worth every penny,love intellishade . dermatologist client sent sample tube year ago love combination fact 45 spf not 10 15 spf ridiculous standard spf face moisturizers tinted enough foundation tone not need apply foundation . protecting skin sun crucial yet dont give greasy sunscreen lotions.so second bottle even price outside comfort level feel entirely worth . product quality high ingredients approved endorsed dermatologist friend trust . skin loves product . wee bit oily normal skin applies nicely gives skin silky smooth effect . add organic mineral powder foundation little blush im donelove love intellishade happy see available amazon best compromise wearing enough sunscreen protect pretty face sun damage still looking great fantastic product worth every penny,"['love', 'intellishade', '.', 'dermatologist', 'client', 'sent', 'sample', 'tube', 'year', 'ago', 'love', 'combination', 'fact', '45', 'spf', 'not', '10', '15', 'spf', 'ridiculous', 'standard', 'spf', 'face', 'moisturizers', 'tinted', 'enough', 'foundation', 'tone', 'not', 'need', 'apply', 'foundation', '.', 'protecting', 'skin', 'sun', 'crucial', 'yet', 'dont', 'give', 'greasy', 'sunscreen', 'lotions.so', 'second', 'bottle', 'even', 'price', 'outside', 'comfort', 'level', 'feel', 'entirely', 'worth', '.', 'product', 'quality', 'high', 'ingredients', 'approved', 'endorsed', 'dermatologist', 'friend', 'trust', '.', 'skin', 'loves', 'product', '.', 'wee', 'bit', 'oily', 'normal', 'skin', 'applies', 'nicely', 'gives', 'skin', 'silky', 'smooth', 'effect', '.', 'add', 'organic', 'mineral', 'powder', 'foundation', 'little', 'blush', 'im', 'donelove', 'love', 'intellishade', 'happy', 'see', 'available', 'amazon', 'best', 'compromise', 'wearing', 'enough', 'sunscreen', 'protect', 'pretty', 'face', 'sun', 'damage', 'still', 'looking', 'great', 'fantastic', 'product', 'worth', 'every', 'penny']"

let me start out by saying i am very fair skinned. however i was not expecting the tint to be quite so dark when they also have a deep option this is a solid medium shade absolutely not intended for people of the caucasian persuasion. so if youre pale be forwarned that this will leave you with a muddy orange cast that does not look nice. fortunately i wear it under makeup but i will be purchasing the untinted version in the future. feels amazing on the skin but way too dark,let start saying fair skinned . however not expecting tint quite dark also deep option solid medium shade absolutely not intended people caucasian persuasion . youre pale forwarned leave muddy orange cast not look nice . fortunately wear makeup purchasing untinted version future . feels amazing skin way dark,"['let', 'start', 'saying', 'fair', 'skinned', '.', 'however', 'not', 'expecting', 'tint', 'quite', 'dark', 'also', 'deep', 'option', 'solid', 'medium', 'shade', 'absolutely', 'not', 'intended', 'people', 'caucasian', 'persuasion', '.', 'youre', 'pale', 'forwarned', 'leave', 'muddy', 'orange', 'cast', 'not', 'look', 'nice', '.', 'fortunately', 'wear', 'makeup', 'purchasing', 'untinted', 'version', 'future', '.', 'feels', 'amazing', 'skin', 'way', 'dark']"

i picked this up based on a recommendation from drdray on youtube. i loved that she swatched all the colors and i thought medium deep would be the best one for me. thats what im wearing in the photo. black girlbrown girl approvedthis is now one of my favorite sunscreens i prefer tinted mineral formulas but sometimes its a challenge to find one with a shade that fits me and that is also watersweat resistant 80 minutes and also affordable. this one is perfect it checks all the boxes this doesnt burn my eyes or cause blurry vision doesnt irritate my oily skin. my sister has dry sensitive skin and also likes this. this has a skinlike finish. might be slightly shiny but thats normal to me. i like to use a fan to help it dry down more. consistency is very thinkind of runny and spreads easily. formula is comfortable and doesnt feel drying. reapplying is a breeze but have to be careful to not get it on clothes. i keep wipes in the car to wipe off my fingers. the coverage is very sheer not like colorscience flex which has more coverage and a much higher price but i also love. this doesnt cover imperfectionsdark marks but it does even out skin tone. some of my foundation colors in case it helps you with choosing a shade armani 7.8 eldw honey bronze kvd 063 mufe 3n42 haus labs 330 dior 4n nars aruba. i use tan in colorscience flex.the only thing i would change about this product is the packaging because it can get a little messy. i wish the opening of the tube was smaller more tapered. im still giving this 5 stars anyway. ive gotten this on my clothes white shirts but has not left any stains i always treat with oxi clean max force stain remover on the same day. washes out completely no staining no trace.i also picked up deep just in case but its too dark. my guess is that its best for people with skin tone mac nc45 and up. however drdray mentioned this is a good option for those who like to use self tanner and want the face to match the fake tan. i wouldnt use this on arms or legs because it will transfer to clothing or other fabric. also i realized the reason the deep shade was priced much lower is because it expires in august 2024 and i bought it june 2024 im stuck with it because i dont want to pay to return it.either way the colors are very sheer and natural looking not too orange pink or chalky. at least thats my opinion. makeup artists say i have an olive skin tone. this totally works for me this tinted mineral sunscreen is a gem,picked based recommendation drdray youtube . loved swatched colors thought medium deep would best one . thats im

im typically opposed to sunscreen because of the stinging of eyes smell and white cast. im from hawaii so the smell of sunscreen typically reminds me of tourists but this sunscreen is not only reef friendly but smells pleasant almost like the smell of bio oil. it also has absolutely no white cast none. i was in so much shock its better than la roche or cerave. im an olive colored mixed blasian woman and the minute it hits your skin it just melts. for some it may seem like its greasy but its perfect for me it gives that korean glass skin look. there is also no piling i noticed with cerave sometimes it would pile or leave white clumps on the edge of my face this does not. i also do not experience any eye burning which is nice. the only reason you would experience this is if you applied it directly over your eye lids or near your eyes which they advise not to do. my only complaint is that it is not water proof so if you plan  on utilizing this during excessive sweating or any type of wet activities lol do not expect this to do its job. that is also stated in the product description. ,im typically opposed sunscreen stinging eyes smell white cast . im hawaii smell sunscreen typically reminds tourists sunscreen not reef friendly smells pleasant almost like smell bio oil . also absolutely no white cast none . much shock better la roche cerave . im olive colored mixed blasian woman minute hits skin melts . may seem like greasy perfect gives korean glass skin look . also no piling noticed cerave sometimes would pile leave white clumps edge face not . also not experience eye burning nice . reason would experience applied directly eye lids near eyes advise not . complaint not water proof plan utilizing excessive sweating type wet activities lol not expect job . also stated product description .,"['im', 'typically', 'opposed', 'sunscreen', 'stinging', 'eyes', 'smell', 'white', 'cast', '.', 'im', 'hawaii', 'smell', 'sunscreen', 'typically', 'reminds', 'tourists', 'sunscreen', 'not', 'reef', 'friendly', 'smells', 'pleasant', 'almost', 'like', 'smell', 'bio', 'oil', '.', 'also', 'absolutely', 'no', 'white', 'cast', 'none', '.', 'much', 'shock', 'better', 'la', 'roche', 'cerave', '.', 'im', 'olive', 'colored', 'mixed', 'blasian', 'woman', 'minute', 'hits', 'skin', 'melts', '.', 'may', 'seem', 'like', 'greasy', 'perfect', 'gives', 'korean', 'glass', 'skin', 'look', '.', 'also', 'no', 'piling', 'noticed', 'cerave', 'sometimes', 'would', 'pile', 'leave', 'white', 'clumps', 'edge', 'face', 'not', '.', 'also', 'not', 'experience', 'eye', 'burning', 'nice', '.', 'reason', 'would', 'experience', 'applied', 'directly', 'eye', 'lids', 'near', 'eyes', 'advise', 'not', '.', 'complaint', 'not', 'water', 'proof', 'plan', 'utilizing', 'excessive', 'sweating', 'type', 'wet', 'activities', 'lol', 'not', 'expect', 'job', '.', 'also', 'stated', 'product', 'description', '.']"

this product is so expensive i feel for a moisturizersunscreen. but i have found nothing else that quite compares to it.i have sensory issues and sometimes i just cannot with most moisturizers or sunscreens. they are so thick and the texture is yuck and they smell and its so overwhelming that either i use up all my spoons for the morning forcing myself to put it on or i skip it entirely which is a problem on days when the uv is like 11. even indoors youve got to wear it.this is my lifesaver and goto.its so thini mean so thin. like putting on milky water almost. it doesnt smell like much of anything to me except maybe mineral water. it doesnt leave my skin feeling filmy or having a weird residue. i can touch my face afterwards and feel like im touching my face and not touching slime or gunk. i can put it on every 2 hours if needed and it doesnt even cause that cakedon build up feel when i do so.the biggest detractors are 1 its not even sortof sweat proof. like it will run the second you sweat at all. 2 this means it will run into your eyes if you put it above the eye like along the brow bone or even low on the forehead. its not as stingy as other brands though if it does run into the eye. 3 its so expensive.i feel like i dont have much choice except to pay for this one because its worth it to have an option like this. but if it was half the current price it would be my first choice every day i wasnt going to be sweating. its my absolute favorite moisturizersunscreen and i hate that fact,product expensive feel moisturizersunscreen . found nothing else quite compares it.i sensory issues sometimes not moisturizers sunscreens . thick texture yuck smell overwhelming either use spoons morning forcing put skip entirely problem days uv like 11. even indoors youve got wear it.this lifesaver goto.its thini mean thin . like putting milky water almost . doesnt smell like much anything except maybe mineral water . doesnt leave skin feeling filmy weird residue . touch face afterwards feel like im touching face not touching slime gunk . put every 2 hours needed doesnt even cause cakedon build feel so.the biggest detractors 1 not even sortof sweat proof . like run second sweat . 2 means run eyes put eye like along brow bone even low forehead . not stingy brands though run eye . 3 expensive.i feel like dont much choice except pay one worth option like . half current price would first choice every day wasnt going sweating . absolute favorite moisturizersunscreen hate fact,"['product', 'expensive', 'feel', 'moisturizersunscreen', '.', 'found', 'nothing', 'else', 'quite', 'compares', 'it.i', 'sensory', 'issues', 'sometimes', 'not', 'moisturizers', 'sunscreens', '.', 'thick', 'texture', 'yuck', 'smell', 'overwhelming', 'either', 'use', 'spoons', 'morning', 'forcing', 'put', 'skip', 'entirely', 'problem', 'days', 'uv', 'like', '11.', 'even', 'indoors', 'youve', 'got', 'wear', 'it.this', 'lifesaver', 'goto.its', 'thini', 'mean', 'thin', '.', 'like', 'putting', 'milky', 'water', 'almost', '.', 'doesnt', 'smell', 'like', 'much', 'anything', 'except', 'maybe', 'mineral', 'water', '.', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'skin', 'feeling', 'filmy', 'weird', 'residue', '.', 'touch', 'face', 'afterwards', 'feel', 'like', 'im', 'touching', 'face', 'not', 'touching', 'slime', 'gunk', '.', 'put', 'every', '2', 'hours', 'needed', 'doesnt', 'even', 'cause', 'cakedon', 'build', 'feel', 'so.the', 'biggest', 'detractors', '1', 'not', 'even', 'sortof', 'sweat', 'proof', '.', 'like', 'run', 'second', 'sweat', '.', '2', 'means', 'run', 'eyes', 'put', 'eye', 'like', 'along', 'brow', 'bone', 'even', 'low', 'forehead', '.', 'not', 'stingy', 'brands', 'though', 'run', 'eye', '.', '3', 'expensive.i', 'feel', 'like', 'dont', 'much', 'choice', 'except', 'pay', 'one', 'worth', 'option', 'like', '.', 'half', 'current', 'price', 'would', 'first', 'choice', 'every', 'day', 'wasnt', 'going', 'sweating', '.', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'moisturizersunscreen', 'hate', 'fact']"

to a flawless radiant complexion. haha what sets this tinted sunblock apart is its ability to tackle multiple concerns with ease. first and foremost it provides the essential sun protection we all need. thats a given. but what truly stands out for me is its magical touch in evening out my skin tone. it conceals the redness on my cheeks and imparts a lovely uniform color to my face leaving me

as a loyal fan of the eltamd brand i was excited to try their tinted sunscreen and for the most part it didnt disappoint.firstly i appreciate eltamds commitment to creating highquality skincare products and this sunscreen is no exception. the oilfree formula is fantastic for my combination skin providing sun protection without feeling heavy or greasy.the tinted formula is a nice touch offering a bit of coverage and helping to even out my skin tone. however i did find it to be a tad more sheer than i expected. while it provides a subtle tint its not quite enough to replace my usual foundation on days when i want more coverage.that being said the sunscreen itself is fantastic. the zinc oxide provides broadspectrum spf protection which is crucial for preventing sun damage and premature aging. plus its noncomedogenic so it wont clog pores or cause breakouts.overall while the tint was a bit sheer for my liking i still think the eltamd uv clear tinted face sunscreen is a solid choice for daily sun protection. if youre looking for a lightweight oilfree sunscreen that also provides a hint of coverage give this one a try. great but a little more sheer than i expected,loyal fan eltamd brand excited try tinted sunscreen part didnt disappoint.firstly appreciate eltamds commitment creating highquality skincare products sunscreen no exception . oilfree formula fantastic combination skin providing sun protection without feeling heavy greasy.the tinted formula nice touch offering bit coverage helping even skin tone . however find tad sheer expected . provides subtle tint not quite enough replace usual foundation days want coverage.that said sunscreen fantastic . zinc oxide provides broadspectrum spf protection crucial preventing sun damage premature aging . plus noncomedogenic wont clog pores cause breakouts.overall tint bit sheer liking still think eltamd uv clear tinted face sunscreen solid choice daily sun protection . youre looking lightweight oilfree sunscreen also provides hint coverage give one try . great little sheer expected,"['loyal', 'fan', 'eltamd', 'brand', 'excited', 'try', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', 'part', 'didnt', 'disappoint.firstly', 'appreciate', 'eltamds', 'commitment', 'creating', 'highquality', 'skincare', 'products', 'sunscreen', 'no', 'exception', '.', 'oilfree', 'formula', 'fantastic', 'combination', 'skin', 'providing', 'sun', 'protection', 'without', 'feeling', 'heavy', 'greasy.the', 'tinted', 'formula', 'nice', 'touch', 'offering', 'bit', 'coverage', 'helping', 'even', 'skin', 'tone', '.', 'however', 'find', 'tad', 'sheer', 'expected', '.', 'provides', 'subtle', 'tint', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'replace', 'usual', 'foundation', 'days', 'want', 'coverage.that', 'said', 'sunscreen', 'fantastic', '.', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'provides', 'broadspectrum', 'spf', 'protection', 'crucial', 'preventing', 'sun', 'damage', 'premature', 'aging', '.', 'plus', 'noncomedogenic', 'wont', 'clog', 'pores', 'cause', 'breakouts.overall', 'tint', 'bit', 'sheer', 'liking', 'still', 'think', 'eltamd', 'uv', 'clear', 'tinted', 'face', 'sunscreen', 'solid', 'choice', 'daily', 'sun', 'protection', '.', 'youre', 'looking', 'lightweight', 'oilfree', 'sunscreen', 'also', 'provides', 'hint', 'coverage', 'give', 'one', 'try', '.', 'great', 'little', 'sheer', 'expected']"

i had to return the first order because when it arrived the product was leaking out the side of the lid below the pump and i couldnt get it to come up into the pump to come out where it is supposed to flow out. i sent it back and had them replace it but the second container wouldnt pump out at all. i thought it best to call the company to ask for assistance since i didnt want to return a second one and give up on the product. i was told by the person who works for the company to turn the tube upsidedown and tap it 8 or 10 times sharply against my other palm to get the product up into the pump applicator since it does not have anything inside to bring the product up into the pump and sometimes it just settles to the bottom of the tube. it was successful and now works just fine. i hope this helps others who might have this problem. i think the packaging should include this instruction printed on the outside of the box so others dont return a perfectly good tube of what is a bit expensive to waste. i really like this product but will admit that it is pricey. i have just started using it so i dont have much to go on yet. what i will say is that i have very sensitive skin prone to rosacea if i try new products so i was happy to find that this caused no irritation for me and i like the bit of tint that it has to even out my skin tone since i have never used foundation. so far i think its a great product. ill revisit this post if anything changes over the course of using the rest of the container.  6 weeks later i love this sunscreen no problems whatsoever i will be purchasing again. very nice product if your new product wont pump out read this,return first order arrived product leaking side lid pump couldnt get come pump come supposed flow . sent back replace second container wouldnt pump . thought best call company ask assistance since didnt want return second one give product . told person works company turn tube upsidedown tap 8 10 times sharply palm get product pump applicator since not anything inside bring product pump sometimes settles bottom tube . successful works fine . hope helps others might problem . think packaging include instruction printed outside box others dont return perfectly good tube bit expensive waste . really like product admit pricey . started using dont much go yet . say sensitive skin prone rosacea try new products happy find caused no irritation like bit tint even skin tone since never used foundation . far think great product . ill revisit post anything changes course using rest container . 6 weeks later love sunscreen no problems whatsoever purchasing . nice product new product wont pump read,"['return', 'first', 'order', 'arrived', 'product', 'leaking', 'side', 'lid', 'pump', 'couldnt', 'get', 'come', 'pump', 'come', 'supposed', 'flow', '.', 'sent', 'back', 'replace', 'second', 'container', 'wouldnt', 'pump', '.', 'thought', 'best', 'call', 'company', 'ask', 'assistance', 'since', 'didnt', 'want', 'return', 'second', 'one', 'give', 'product', '.', 'told', 'person', 'works', 'company', 'turn', 'tube', 'upsidedown', 'tap', '8', '10', 'times', 'sharply', 'palm', 'get', 'product', 'pump', 'applicator', 'since', 'not', 'anything', 'inside', 'bring', 'product', 'pump', 'sometimes', 'settles', 'bottom', 'tube', '.', 'successful', 'works', 'fine', '.', 'hope', 'helps', 'others', 'might', 'problem', '.', 'think', 'packaging', 'include', 'instruction', 'printed', 'outside', 'box', 'others', 'dont', 'return', 'perfectly', 'good', 'tube', 'bit', 'expensive', 'waste', '.', 'really', 'like', 'product', 'admit', 'pricey', '.', 'started', 'using', 'dont', 'much', 'go', 'yet', '.', 'say', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'prone', 'rosacea', 'try', 'new', 'products', 'happy', 'find', 'caused', 'no', 'irritation', 'like', 'bit', 'tint', 'even', 'skin', 'tone', 'since', 'never', 'used', 'foundation', '.', 'far', 'think', 'great', 'product', '.', 'ill', 'revisit', 'post', 'anything', 'changes', 'course', 'using', 'rest', 'container', '.', '6', 'weeks', 'later', 'love', 'sunscreen', 'no', 'problems', 'whatsoever', 'purchasing', '.', 'nice', 'product', 'new', 'product', 'wont', 'pump', 'read']"

i could be married to this sunscreen for life but that is not going to happen until they fix the problematic packaging.i decided to try this out based on a recommendation from drdray because she recently made a video on the newly released deep tint version. i had never tried any elta md sunscreens before. but i had assumed this regular tinted version wouldnt work for my skin tone. but i soon found out the deep tint is actually too dark for me when i use the appropriate amount. turns out this regular tint is perfect for me and that doesnt happen very often. its lightweight spreads easily and blends flawlessly into my skin. i usually go for mineral formulas but id make an exception for this. it doesnt burn my eyes or cause blurry vision and doesnt irritate my oily skin. this has a skinlike finish. consistency is thin and spreads easily. formula is comfortable to wear actually moisturizing and doesnt feel drying. not greasy at all. reapplying is a breeze when the pump works because sometimes it doesnt. i keep wipes in the car to wipe off my fingers. the coverage is very sheer not like colorscience flex which has more coverage and a higher price but i also love. some of my foundation colors in case it helps you with choosing a shade armani 7.8 eldw honey bronze kvd 063 mufe 3n42 haus labs 330 dior 4n nars aruba. i use tan in colorscience flex.i noticed many other reviewers have the same complaints about the faulty pump. the pump worked fine on my deep tint bottle. but this one took about 100  pumps a prayer and an unwavering spirit to get the very first drop out. then it didnt work when i tried to reapply 2 hours later. its working again for now. but im concerned it will cause issues in the future. and this price tag is a lot to take a chance on it malfunctioning again in the future. i would not be happy if it breaks before im able to finish the bottle. im on the fence about exchanging it or returning it and waiting until the packaging changes.edit to add i decided to keep it because the formula is that good and i havent had any further issues with the bottle. id give it 100 stars but the packaging is problematic,could married

i was not really a fan of tinted sunscreen because i was afraid that it could worsen my acne even when it says for acneprone dry my skin out darken my skin tone and the list goes on i even opted elta md out of my list because i tried their sunscreen before and it irritated my face badlyreapplying sunscreen every 2 hours is absolutely necessary if you want continuous protection especially if youre treating your acne or dark spots. im treating both so yeah i have to follow this rule. but the problem with regular sunscreens whether chemical or mineral is that after like the 3rd reapplication in a day it starts to form a white cast on my face and it makes me look horrible.so the journey begins i looked for tinted sunscreens hoping that it would solve this problem. i tried 2 from other brands and they did but they left my face looking shiny in a bad way i got upset but i still wanted to keep looking and after having watched a few youtube videos. i decided to pick this one and im so happy that i didfirst it doesnt cause irritation which was amazing because their untinted did.second it blends onto my skin quickly easily and without compromising your skin tone. the tint looks dark when i get it on my hands at first but then it goes almost transparent after i spread it all over my face. and because of this it doesnt really darken my skin tone at all after multiple applications throughout the day.third it feels oily but doesnt make my face look shiny. so it further encourages me to reapply every 2 hours.fourth it is not waterresistant. you may not want to use this sunscreen if youre heading to the beach or living your life outdoor on a rainy day. but if you spend most of the time indoor while the outside is sunny and dry and you have little contact with water this sunscreen is fabulous on top of that you can avoid the hassle at night that is trying to remove it off your face. using just water may or may not be effective so i still need to use an oilbased cleanser first to remove it. the thing here is that i need just a tiny bit of the cleanser with little to no rubbing to get the job done.and last but not least it sure protects you from those uv rays. i have used this for a week and havent got any sunburnt or any sign of worsening dark spots on my face and neck. and while protecting my skin the sheer tint also hides away my red  dark spots even my skin tone and therefore making my face look betteroverall this is a 1010 sunscreen for acneprone sensitive skin type. it solves all kinds of hassles that stop you from consistently applying andor reapplying sunscreen. this gets rid of all kinds of reasons you may not want to use sunscreen,not really fan tinted sunscreen afraid could worsen acne even says acneprone dry skin darken skin tone

update setting powder over this sunscreen is a great combo also keeps my oily skin nice and matte.i almost deducted a star because this sunscreen and its tint can rub off which i dont like. i didnt want something more like makeup than a moisturizer. i wanted a sunscreen that didnt leave my face so pale and was willing to try mineral instead of chemical to see which i like better. overall this sunscreen is great.price  it is pricey. there are less expensive ones out there but also much more expensive ones. i got this on sale so i was okay with what i paid.ingredients  i appreciate bliss being cruelty free and including several natural ingredients in their products. that goes for this product too.scent  not the traditional sunscreen smell just the lovely herbal scent of lavender. i have never used a sunscreen like thati think its great.skin type  i have combo oily skinnormal in the cheeks and oilyacneprone in the tzone. this did not make my face greasy or cause breakouts. it made my skin tone look very even and like i was wearing a very light coverage foundation. it left my face feeling soft. it does not leave a matte finish on its own but maybe setting powder applied on top could give that effect im also considering switching to a matte moisturizer so i look forward to seeing what that could do. of course your skin may be greasy after using this if you dont prep for it properly. for example i use things like a foaming cleanser and niacinamide serum to balance oiliness. overall i believe this sunscreen would be friendly to all skin types.durability  i dont think this product would hold up through intense exercise but that depends on how much you sweat and wipe your face as well as the air temperature where you live. i played sports moderate intensity while wearing this one day and it held up fine because nothing touched my face. i would not use a hat or sweat towel with it because the tint wipes off. that is to be expected with mineral sunscreen which is supposed to sit on top of the skin so keep that in mind.in conclusion  this sunscreen is a keeper. i would wear it for special occasions light to moderately active days and when i am not worried about it rubbing off on fabrics however  i will buy a more affordable durable and sheer sunscreen to have as well especially for game days  beach days  or really any day where i dont want my sunscreen sitting on top of my face. ,update setting powder sunscreen great combo also keeps oily skin nice matte.i almost deducted star sunscreen tint rub dont like . didnt want something like makeup

loved the texture and as someone who is super sensitive so sensitive that i have had courses of prednisonesteriods to survive the rashes and reactions to things labeled sensitive skin et al this one refreshingly did not cause my skin to react but it unfortunately is too dark and orangey for very light skin like mine.also as one who is by profession very picky about color and accuracy literally this is what i teach and do as a professor teaching and in my work as a long time professional in the entertainment and creative industries they over compensated re color on this one. this one like some of the other new similar ones by these better manufacturers is too dark and incorrectly undertoned.for so long these manufacturers made these tinted mineral sunscreens way too light making it impossible to use for darker skin. now more than a few have begun to try and fix that but they now have overcompensated and ended up as well making the same mistake makeup manufacturers of the past made incorrect undertone. so as wonderful as this products texture and purity is the color is just not good enough for me and the undertone is too warm they failed to consider how the skin would look as the product sat on it for awhile and warmed up.warm undertoned skins may therefore end up looking orange after some hours wearing this and very light colored skin and those who are prone to redness may especially find themselves looking like they just spent a day in the sun.very disappointing as the texture is fabulous indeed and it truly is one that at least for me did not cauxe my skin to scream and complain i hope they really humble themselves and take some advice from truly expert colorists and makeup artists such as ms. brown nars and we who actually have mfas and ph.ds in such stuff. if the manufacturer is reading this i hope it truly reaches out and accepts help getting this color issue right. it is possible but you need to take advice from the color experts vs. just

i dont know why i put off trying this for so long other than the concern that the tint would be too dark and dry for my skin. for context most tinted sunscreens are way too dark and orange for me and ive tried a lot of them from elta australian gold la roche posay etc.when i first squeezed this out of the tube i thought it was another fail but it blends in seamlessly while still imparting a nice tintglow. it definitely wont replace a foundation or even a legit skin tint but for no makeup days this is perfect. my makeup ive tried both uoma foundation and undone tint over it applied perfectly with no patchy wear throughout the day. it wouldnt say its moisturizing but it also doesnt suck moisture from your skin.the only downside was that the tube i received was 50 full or maybe even less. i dont know if this is typical but i felt a little shortchanged. spfecial but only about 50 filled,dont know put trying long concern tint would dark dry skin . context tinted sunscreens way dark orange ive tried lot elta australian gold la roche posay etc.when first squeezed tube thought another fail blends seamlessly still imparting nice tintglow . definitely wont replace foundation even legit skin tint no makeup days perfect . makeup ive tried uoma foundation undone tint applied perfectly no patchy wear throughout day . wouldnt say moisturizing also doesnt suck moisture skin.the downside tube received 50 full maybe even less . dont know typical felt little shortchanged . spfecial 50 filled,"['dont', 'know', 'put', 'trying', 'long', 'concern', 'tint', 'would', 'dark', 'dry', 'skin', '.', 'context', 'tinted', 'sunscreens', 'way', 'dark', 'orange', 'ive', 'tried', 'lot', 'elta', 'australian', 'gold', 'la', 'roche', 'posay', 'etc.when', 'first', 'squeezed', 'tube', 'thought', 'another', 'fail', 'blends', 'seamlessly', 'still', 'imparting', 'nice', 'tintglow', '.', 'definitely', 'wont', 'replace', 'foundation', 'even', 'legit', 'skin', 'tint', 'no', 'makeup', 'days', 'perfect', '.', 'makeup', 'ive', 'tried', 'uoma', 'foundation', 'undone', 'tint', 'applied', 'perfectly', 'no', 'patchy', 'wear', 'throughout', 'day', '.', 'wouldnt', 'say', 'moisturizing', 'also', 'doesnt', 'suck', 'moisture', 'skin.the', 'downside', 'tube', 'received', '50', 'full', 'maybe', 'even', 'less', '.', 'dont', 'know', 'typical', 'felt', 'little', 'shortchanged', '.', 'spfecial', '50', 'filled']"
i have been obsessed with sunscreen lately. i have acne prone skin so i was look for a tinted mineral one. i was looking for something less fluid than the lrp tinted one bcs it stained some clothes while i was applying it. i tried cotz prime and protect and while its very nice it doesnt work the best with my powder foundation its fantastic though just not for me i bet it looks great under liquid foundation. i also tried cerave tinted and i love that one for daily wear. this one though is so pretty. its almost like a mousse and looks like skin. its too soon to tell if the scent will be a problem in terms of causing sensitivity but it is annoyingly strong. i cant imagine why they would have gone with lavender much less such a strong chemical lavender. very elegant formula but that smell.,obsessed sunscreen lately . acne prone skin look tinted mineral one . looking something less fluid lrp tinted one bcs stained clothes applying . tried cotz prime protect nice doesnt work best powder foundation fantastic though not bet looks great liquid foundation . also tried cerave tinted love one daily wear . one though pretty . almost like mousse looks like skin . soon tell scent problem terms causing sensitivity annoyingly strong . cant imagine would gone lavender much less strong chemical lavender . elegant formula smell .,"['obsessed', 'sunscreen', 'lately', '.', 'acne', 'prone', 'skin', 'look', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'one', '.', 'looking', 'something', 'less', 'fluid', 'lrp', 'tinted', 'one', 'bcs', 'stained', 'clothes', 'applying', '.', 'tried', 'cotz', 'prime', 'protect', 'nice', 'doesnt', 'work', 'best', 'powder', 'foundation', 'fantastic', 'though', 'not', 'bet', 'looks', 'great', 'liquid', 'foundation', '.', 'also', 'tried', 'cerave', 'tinted', 'love', 'one', 'daily', 'wear', '.', 'one', 'though', 'pretty', '.', 'almost', 'like', 'mousse', 'looks', 'like', 'skin', '.', 'soon', 'tell', 'scent', 'problem', 'terms', 'causing', 'sensitivity', 'annoyingly', 'strong', '.', 'cant', 'imagine', 'would', 'gone', 'lavender', 'much', 'less', 'strong', 'chemical', 'lavender', '.', 'elegant', 'formula', 'smell', '.']"

heres the thing it doesnt have multiple color options so if youre not the right shade youre stuck. i feel like thats a bit of a disservice when dealing with a product that is supposed to apply color to the face and match your skintone. like foundation or concealer if your going to put out a skintone focused product there should be enough range to cover many different skintones. theres one shade. thats it. and even on me a paler girl its a bit too yellow and i have to work with it for it to be unnoticeable. the color reminds me of back in the day when the only undertone to exist in affordable makeup was an unflattering yellow. the bane of my cool toned existence lol.however i dont even know if theres actually a tint like yes theres a color when i first apply but its like the pigment literally disappears after your rub it into your face. ive even wiped my hands on my dark grey sleep shirt after applying and it didnt leave color on my shirt why wouldnt it do that when its supposed to be a tinted product shouldnt it leave color behind if i wiped it off my hands and onto my shirt how can a product be invisible and tinted at the same timei mean if it was meant to go on tinted and then turn clear to match your skintone i feel like that kinda defeats the purpose of a tinted product. i dont understand how this product can effortlessly blend into all skintones with only one color.also it does have a sunscreen smell. personally i dont mind it but i know there are people who dont want a smell with their sunscreen or facial products in general.all the negatives aside if your the right shade and you dont mind the smell then its a nice tinted sunscreen and i feel like it does protect from the sun. theres just too many other variables  that make me not so happy with the product. if there was a better shade range and the tint actually stayed i might like it more. i have mixed feelings  explained,heres thing doesnt multiple color options youre not right shade youre

this tinted sunscreen is a subscribe and save product for me. ive probably gone through 7 to 10 tubes of this and i always have a backup ready. i wear this everyday over a chemical jbeauty or kbeauty spf in place of foundation. to be clear though this is not a foundation and wont give that effect. its a very no make up make up look like you just have a healthy natural glow to your skin. i do still wear concealer under the eyes on top to look more done. im in my early 40s and have found my skin to be getting a bit drier these days and this continues to work well. given everyday use and occasional reapplication a tube lasts around 6 weeks. my skin tone is light medium around an nc25 or c23 for those familiar with mac. the tone leans mostly neutral maybe a hint of cool tone.  im not sure if this would work for medium or darker skin. great mineral tinted spf,tinted sunscreen subscribe save product . ive probably gone 7 10 tubes always backup ready . wear everyday chemical jbeauty kbeauty spf place foundation . clear though not foundation wont give effect . no make make look like healthy natural glow skin . still wear concealer eyes top look done . im early 40s found skin getting bit drier days continues work well . given everyday use occasional reapplication tube lasts around 6 weeks . skin tone light medium around nc25 c23 familiar mac . tone leans mostly neutral maybe hint cool tone . im not sure would work medium darker skin . great mineral tinted spf,"['tinted', 'sunscreen', 'subscribe', 'save', 'product', '.', 'ive', 'probably', 'gone', '7', '10', 'tubes', 'always', 'backup', 'ready', '.', 'wear', 'everyday', 'chemical', 'jbeauty', 'kbeauty', 'spf', 'place', 'foundation', '.', 'clear', 'though', 'not', 'foundation', 'wont', 'give', 'effect', '.', 'no', 'make', 'make', 'look', 'like', 'healthy', 'natural', 'glow', 'skin', '.', 'still', 'wear', 'concealer', 'eyes', 'top', 'look', 'done', '.', 'im', 'early', '40s', 'found', 'skin', 'getting', 'bit', 'drier', 'days', 'continues', 'work', 'well', '.', 'given', 'everyday', 'use', 'occasional', 'reapplication', 'tube', 'lasts', 'around', '6', 'weeks', '.', 'skin', 'tone', 'light', 'medium', 'around', 'nc25', 'c23', 'familiar', 'mac', '.', 'tone', 'leans', 'mostly', 'neutral', 'maybe', 'hint', 'cool', 'tone', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'work', 'medium', 'darker', 'skin', '.', 'great', 'mineral', 'tinted', 'spf']"

im still deciding how i feel about this product. i took forever deciding on a moisturizer as the one i usually use doesnt contain spf. i bought this when it didnt have any reviews on amazon yet but i did some research elsewhere and decided to give it a go.pros i like what this company stands for that the product contains minimal relatively ingredients is reef safe etc. it does provide a lovely lasting glow as advertised which is a plus for me because my skin tends to be slightly dry. it lasted longer than expected on my face without needing to reapply. i wore light makeup over it once and my makeup applied beautifully. finally i do love the look of the bottle. it is simple and chic.cons im not sure if all bottles are like this or if something happened to mine during shipping but the product is definitely a little separated. ive had to shake it vigorously to try to remix but that only slightly worked. it does smell like sunscreen at least to me. there is another lighter scent as well that is possibly supposed to mask it but i can smell the sunscreen on myself for at least an hour after applying. i hate the smell of sunscreen but ive yet to find a good spf that doesnt have it so not a deal breaker. this product did sting very slightly but i also typically find this with spf products. my skin is naturally clear but somewhat sensitive and breaks out easily. i didnt majorly break out from this product as i have from others but a couple of pimples did start to appear. ill continue to use the product to determine if this was the cause.overall i do recommend the product but i would be very interested in testing a bottle that wasnt so separated to see if it worked better for my skin good pros and cons,im still deciding feel product . took forever deciding moisturizer one usually use doesnt contain spf . bought didnt reviews amazon yet research elsewhere decided give go.pros like company stands product contains minimal relatively ingredients reef safe etc . provide lovely lasting glow advertised plus skin tends slightly dry . lasted longer expected face without needing reapply . wore light makeup makeup applied beautifully . finally love look bottle . simple chic.cons im not sure bottles like something happened mine shipping product definitely little separated . ive shake vigorously try remix slightly worked . smell like sunscreen least . another lighter scent well possibly supposed mask smell sunscreen least hour applying . hate smell sunscreen ive yet find good spf doesnt not deal breaker . product sting slightly also typically find spf products . skin naturally clear somewhat sensitive breaks easily . didnt majorly break product others couple pimples start appear . ill continue use product determine cause.overall recommend product would interested testing bottle wasnt separated see worked better skin good pros cons,"['im', 'still', 'deciding', 'feel', 'product', '.', 'took', 'forever', 'deciding', 'moisturizer', 'one', 'usually', 'use', 'doesnt', 'contain', 'spf', '.', 'bought', 'didnt', 'reviews', 'amazon', 'yet', 'research', 'elsewhere', 'decided', 'give', 'go.pros', 'like', 'company', 'stands', 'product', 'contains', 'minimal', 'relatively', 'ingredients', 'reef', 'safe', 'etc', '.', 'provide', 'lovely', 'lasting', 'glow', 'advertised', 'plus', 'skin', 'tends', 'slightly', 'dry', '.', 'lasted', 'longer', 'expected', 'face', 'without', 'needing', 'reapply', '.', 'wore', 'light', 'makeup', 'makeup', 'applied', 'beautifully', '.', 'finally', 'love', 'look', 'bottle', '.', 'simple', 'chic.cons', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'bottles', 'like', 'something', 'happened', 'mine', 'shipping', 'product', 'definitely', 'little', 'separated', '.', 'ive', 'shake', 'vigorously', 'try', 'remix', 'slightly', 'worked', '.', 'smell', 'like', 'sunscreen', 'least', '.', 'another', 'lighter', 'scent', 'well', 'possibly', 'supposed', 'mask', 'smell', 'sunscreen', 'least', 'hour', 'applying', '.', 'hate', 'smell', 'sunscreen', 'ive', 'yet', 'find', 'good', 'spf', 'doesnt', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', '.', 'product', 'sting', 'slightly', 'also', 'typically', 'find', 'spf', 'products', '.', 'skin', 'naturally', 'clear', 'somewhat', 'sensitive', 'breaks', 'easily', '.', 'didnt', 'majorly', 'break', 'product', 'others', 'couple', 'pimples', 'start', 'appear', '.', 'ill', 'continue', 'use', 'product', 'determine', 'cause.overall', 'recommend', 'product', 'would', 'interested', 'testing', 'bottle', 'wasnt', 'separated', 'see', 'worked', 'better', 'skin', 'good', 'pros', 'cons']"

i want to preface this review by stating that i have combination skin and have used my fair share of asian sunscreens skin1004 beauty of joseon nivea biore roundlab etc. a common theme among all of them is their lightweight feel. better put they dont feel like susncreens they just feel like nice lightweight moisturizers which is what i love about them. this feel is made possible because asian brands have a lot of freedom with sun filter formlations not possible in the us because of fda regulations. anyway it turns out that cosrx took the time to have this specific sunscreen fda approved which is why the list of ingredients resembles that of us sunscreens a whole lot. i only realized this after trying it on for the first time because contrary to the other reviews it is very greasy and heavy. now my definition of greasy and heavy is based on the time it takes to absorb into the skin and how it feels after. it will take a good minute to fully blend this into the skin and youll definitely feel it on your skin for a good hour after application. it will feel like a sunscreen. it reminded me a lot of la roche posay and banana boat sunscreens yes i consider those heavy and greasy. to be completely fair though i am a little spoiled by asian sunscreens so if youre used to how us sunscreens feel youll be fine with this. in summary dont buy this sunscreen if youre looking for a typical lightweight asian sunscreen. not your usual kbeauty sunscreen,want preface review stating combination skin used fair share asian sunscreens skin1004 beauty joseon nivea biore roundlab etc . common theme among lightweight feel . better put dont feel like susncreens feel like nice lightweight moisturizers love . feel made possible asian brands lot freedom sun filter formlations not possible us fda regulations . anyway turns cosrx took time specific sunscreen fda approved list ingredients resembles us sunscreens whole lot . realized trying first time contrary reviews greasy heavy . definition greasy heavy based time takes absorb skin feels . take good minute fully blend skin youll definitely feel skin good hour application . feel like sunscreen . reminded lot la roche posay banana boat sunscreens yes consider heavy greasy . completely fair though little spoiled asian sunscreens youre used us sunscreens feel youll fine . summary dont buy sunscreen youre looking typical lightweight asian sunscreen . not usual kbeauty sunscreen,"['want', 'preface', 'review', 'stating', 'combination', 'skin', 'used', 'fair', 'share', 'asian', 'sunscreens', 'skin1004', 'beauty', 'joseon', 'nivea', 'biore', 'roundlab', 'etc', '.', 'common', 'theme', 'among', 'lightweight', 'feel', '.', 'better', 'put', 'dont', 'feel', 'like', 'susncreens', 'feel', 'like', 'nice', 'lightweight', 'moisturizers', 'love', '.', 'feel', 'made', 'possible', 'asian', 'brands', 'lot', 'freedom', 'sun', 'filter', 'formlations', 'not', 'possible', 'us', 'fda', 'regulations', '.', 'anyway', 'turns', 'cosrx', 'took', 'time', 'specific', 'sunscreen', 'fda', 'approved', 'list', 'ingredients', 'resembles', 'us', 'sunscreens', 'whole', 'lot', '.', 'realized', 'trying', 'first', 'time', 'contrary', 'reviews', 'greasy', 'heavy', '.', 'definition', 'greasy', 'heavy', 'based', 'time', 'takes', 'absorb', 'skin', 'feels', '.', 'take', 'good', 'minute', 'fully', 'blend', 'skin', 'youll', 'definitely', 'feel', 'skin', 'good', 'hour', 'application', '.', 'feel', 'like', 'sunscreen', '.', 'reminded', 'lot', 'la', 'roche', 'posay', 'banana', 'boat', 'sunscreens', 'yes', 'consider', 'heavy', 'greasy', '.', 'completely', 'fair', 'though', 'little', 'spoiled', 'asian', 'sunscreens', 'youre', 'used', 'us', 'sunscreens', 'feel', 'youll', 'fine', '.', 'summary', 'dont', 'buy', 'sunscreen', 'youre', 'looking', 'typical', 'lightweight', 'asian', 'sunscreen', '.', 'not', 'usual', 'kbeauty', 'sunscreen']"

    ive been using the cosrx daily spf 50 vitamin e sunscreen for a bit over 6 months and its been pretty solid overall. since this is a chemical based sunscreen it gets absorbed pretty fast and doesnt leave any white casts. the finish is glowy and dewy which is great for dry skin but it might not be ideal for oily skin types.that being said one issue for me was that while it advertises that it provides a spf 50 broadspectrum for uvb protection it does not specify the pa rating for the uva protection which has typically been specified in other cosrx sunscreens. ive reached out about this a few months ago but havent heard back anything from them. also i experienced some irritations when i applied it near the eye area. so dont use this near the eye.other than that its a decent sunscreen but the lack of clear uva protection info is a bit of a letdown. solid sunscreen but lacks uva protection details",. ive using cosrx daily spf 50 vitamin e sunscreen bit 6 months pretty solid overall . since chemical based sunscreen gets absorbed pretty fast doesnt leave white casts . finish glowy dewy great dry skin might not ideal oily skin types.that said one issue advertises provides spf 50 broadspectrum uvb protection not specify pa rating uva protection typically specified cosrx sunscreens . ive reached months ago havent heard back anything . also experienced irritations applied near eye area . dont use near eye.other decent sunscreen lack clear uva protection info bit letdown . solid sunscreen lacks uva protection details,"['.', 'ive', 'using', 'cosrx', 'daily', 'spf', '50', 'vitamin', 'e', 'sunscreen', 'bit', '6', 'months', 'pretty', 'solid', 'overall', '.', 'since', 'chemical', 'based', 'sunscreen', 'gets', 'absorbed', 'pretty', 'fast', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'white', 'casts', '.', 'finish', 'glowy', 'dewy', 'great', 'dry', 'skin', 'might', 'not', 'ideal', 'oily', 'skin', 'types.that', 'said', 'one', 'issue', 'advertises', 'provides', 'spf', '50', 'broadspectrum', 'uvb', 'protection', 'not', 'specify', 'pa', 'rating', 'uva', 'protection', 'typically', 'specified', 'cosrx', 'sunscreens', '.', 'ive', 'reached', 'months', 'ago', 'havent', 'heard', 'back', 'anything', '.', 'also', 'experienced', 'irritations', 'applied', 'near', 'eye', 'area', '.', 'dont', 'use', 'near', 'eye.other', 'decent', 'sunscreen', 'lack', 'clear', 'uva', 'protection', 'info', 'bit', 'letdown', '.', 'solid', 'sunscreen', 'lacks', 'uva', 'protection', 'details']"

i really wanted to like this sunscreen more but after several wears ive decided its just fine for what it is.if you are looking for coverage something to cover up redness this product isnt going to do it. the tint seems to be just to cover up any white cast. i have fair cooltoned skin and the light shade was fine i can see it working for different undertones of light skin due to the sheer tint.for the texture i wasnt very impressed. its thicker than i wanted it to be and isnt something i would recommend layering or reapplying over itself which isnt great for a sunscreen. if youre used to asian sunscreens you will be disappointed. on my combination skin with dry patches it doesnt always feel like it dries down all the way and leaves a slightly dewy finish. i dont mind it too much though it feels moisturizing and isnt greasy like traditional beach sunscreens. i wear it under makeup and get a small amount of pilling with my normal foundation but its easily fixable.also for the texture i would expect more than just an spf 30on the bright side though it hasnt broken me out and no eye stinging. i think if you have sensitive skin and want a mineral sunscreen without a white cast you might like this. i wanted this to be the sunscreen that finally made me like mineral sunscreens but i guess ill just always be an organic filters girl. ,really wanted like sunscreen several wears ive decided fine is.if looking coverage something cover redness product isnt going . tint seems cover white cast . fair cooltoned skin light shade fine see working different undertones light skin due sheer tint.for texture wasnt impressed . thicker wanted isnt something would recommend layering reapplying isnt great sunscreen . youre used asian sunscreens disappointed . combination skin dry patches doesnt always feel like dries way leaves slightly dewy finish . dont mind much though feels moisturizing isnt greasy like traditional beach sunscreens . wear makeup get small amount pilling normal foundation easily fixable.also texture would expect spf 30on bright side though hasnt broken no eye stinging . think sensitive skin want mineral sunscreen without white cast might like . wanted sunscreen finally made like mineral sunscreens guess ill always organic filters girl .,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'sunscreen', 'several', 'wears', 'ive', 'decided', 'fine', 'is.if', 'looking', 'coverage', 'something', 'cover', 'redness', 'product', 'isnt', 'going', '.', 'tint', 'seems', 'cover', 'white', 'cast', '.', 'fair', 'cooltoned', 'skin', 'light', 'shade', 'fine', 'see', 'working', 'different', 'undertones', 'light', 'skin', 'due', 'sheer', 'tint.for', 'texture', 'wasnt', 'impressed', '.', 'thicker', 'wanted', 'isnt', 'something', 'would', 'recommend', 'layering', 'reapplying', 'isnt', 'great', 'sunscreen', '.', 'youre', 'used', 'asian', 'sunscreens', 'disappointed', '.', 'combination', 'skin', 'dry', 'patches', 'doesnt', 'always', 'feel', 'like', 'dries', 'way', 'leaves', 'slightly', 'dewy', 'finish', '.', 'dont', 'mind', 'much', 'though', 'feels', 'moisturizing', 'isnt', 'greasy', 'like', 'traditional', 'beach', 'sunscreens', '.', 'wear', 'makeup', 'get', 'small', 'amount', 'pilling', 'normal', 'foundation', 'easily', 'fixable.also', 'texture', 'would', 'expect', 'spf', '30on', 'bright', 'side', 'though', 'hasnt', 'broken', 'no', 'eye', 'stinging', '.', 'think', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'want', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'without', 'white', 'cast', 'might', 'like', '.', 'wanted', 'sunscreen', 'finally', 'made', 'like', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'guess', 'ill', 'always', 'organic', 'filters', 'girl', '.']"

so i have tried many  many mineral sunscreens and chemical sunscreens. i prefer mineral for my face to prevent  treat hyperpigmentation. my favorite holy grail is skinceuticals tinted mineral  but its very expensive. im always on the hunt for a more affordable option. when i first got this i almost returned because its not a tinted mineral in the sense that it evens out skin tone or hides anything its a peachy color to cover the white cast  however  i like the ease of application and no white cast. it works great under my makeup and looks flawless. ive even done just concealer and bronzer and it still looks good. its very hydrating  shiny though so if you dont have dry skin like me  you will not like it. if you skipped moisturizer it could be perfect. this is even a good one to wear to the beach and reapply without worrying you look like casper. lastly my bottle has not leaked like some other reviews have stated. i close the cap tight and when i apply it i hold it upright so it wont leak out  its a more liquid fluid to help it apply easily.  i recommend  one of the best affordable tinted minerals,tried many many mineral sunscreens chemical sunscreens . prefer mineral face prevent treat hyperpigmentation . favorite holy grail skinceuticals tinted mineral expensive . im always hunt affordable option . first got almost returned not tinted mineral sense evens skin tone hides anything peachy color cover white cast however like ease application no white cast . works great makeup looks flawless . ive even done concealer bronzer still looks good . hydrating shiny though dont dry skin like not like . skipped moisturizer could perfect . even good one wear beach reapply without worrying look like casper . lastly bottle not leaked like reviews stated . close cap tight apply hold upright wont leak liquid fluid help apply easily . recommend one best affordable tinted minerals,"['tried', 'many', 'many', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', '.', 'prefer', 'mineral', 'face', 'prevent', 'treat', 'hyperpigmentation', '.', 'favorite', 'holy', 'grail', 'skinceuticals', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'expensive', '.', 'im', 'always', 'hunt', 'affordable', 'option', '.', 'first', 'got', 'almost', 'returned', 'not', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'sense', 'evens', 'skin', 'tone', 'hides', 'anything', 'peachy', 'color', 'cover', 'white', 'cast', 'however', 'like', 'ease', 'application', 'no', 'white', 'cast', '.', 'works', 'great', 'makeup', 'looks', 'flawless', '.', 'ive', 'even', 'done', 'concealer', 'bronzer', 'still', 'looks', 'good', '.', 'hydrating', 'shiny', 'though', 'dont', 'dry', 'skin', 'like', 'not', 'like', '.', 'skipped', 'moisturizer', 'could', 'perfect', '.', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'wear', 'beach', 'reapply', 'without', 'worrying', 'look', 'like', 'casper', '.', 'lastly', 'bottle', 'not', 'leaked', 'like', 'reviews', 'stated', '.', 'close', 'cap', 'tight', 'apply', 'hold', 'upright', 'wont', 'leak', 'liquid', 'fluid', 'help', 'apply', 'easily', '.', 'recommend', 'one', 'best', 'affordable', 'tinted', 'minerals']"

my first concern any time i use a new product on my skin is my sensitivity. my skin loves to complain. i usually avoid regular drugstore type products like this because they tend to emphasize price over quality. i need both quality and value. each time i try a new product i must test my skin to first see if i am allergic and second to see if it causes my skin to breakout or flake. amazingly this neutrogena mineral uv tint face liquid passed that very large hurdle. my skin did not complain at all. next i looked at coverage color and how long it lasts without reapplication. again i was pleased with the results. these days everyone is also concerned with value. i thought this was a bit pricey for the volume of applications in the tube and considering this is a lowerend drugstore marketed product. i found it on sale but the regular price is too high for the product value. if it were less expensive or contained larger volume of product it would have rated 5 stars. i hope they take this advice so this can become a regularly used product on more shelves. neutrogena mineral uv tint face liquid,first concern time use new product skin sensitivity . skin loves complain . usually avoid regular drugstore type products like tend emphasize price quality . need quality value . time try new product must test skin first see allergic second see causes skin breakout flake . amazingly neutrogena mineral uv tint face liquid passed large hurdle . skin not complain . next looked coverage color long lasts without reapplication . pleased results . days everyone also concerned value . thought bit pricey volume applications tube considering lowerend drugstore marketed product . found sale regular price high product value . less expensive contained larger volume product would rated 5 stars . hope take advice become regularly used product shelves . neutrogena mineral uv tint face liquid,"['first', 'concern', 'time', 'use', 'new', 'product', 'skin', 'sensitivity', '.', 'skin', 'loves', 'complain', '.', 'usually', 'avoid', 'regular', 'drugstore', 'type', 'products', 'like', 'tend', 'emphasize', 'price', 'quality', '.', 'need', 'quality', 'value', '.', 'time', 'try', 'new', 'product', 'must', 'test', 'skin', 'first', 'see', 'allergic', 'second', 'see', 'causes', 'skin', 'breakout', 'flake', '.', 'amazingly', 'neutrogena', 'mineral', 'uv', 'tint', 'face', 'liquid', 'passed', 'large', 'hurdle', '.', 'skin', 'not', 'complain', '.', 'next', 'looked', 'coverage', 'color', 'long', 'lasts', 'without', 'reapplication', '.', 'pleased', 'results', '.', 'days', 'everyone', 'also', 'concerned', 'value', '.', 'thought', 'bit', 'pricey', 'volume', 'applications', 'tube', 'considering', 'lowerend', 'drugstore', 'marketed', 'product', '.', 'found', 'sale', 'regular', 'price', 'high', 'product', 'value', '.', 'less', 'expensive', 'contained', 'larger', 'volume', 'product', 'would', 'rated', '5', 'stars', '.', 'hope', 'take', 'advice', 'become', 'regularly', 'used', 'product', 'shelves', '.', 'neutrogena', 'mineral', 'uv', 'tint', 'face', 'liquid']"

after a horrible allergic reaction to a chemical sunscreen also from neutrogena i made the switch to mineral sunscreens. as a darkerskinned asian woman its hard to find products that are yellow enough without being too orange. in winter the medium deep of this product on application is an exact match to my skin to the point i sometimes cant see if i missed a spot to blend in. it does get just slightly darker with dryingoxidation but not enough to be concerning. its decently moisturizing  i wear it only over a serum and eye cream. if anything its slightly greasy on me. it is quite runny which i like as far as being lightweight feeling on my face but agree with others that it makes for a mess  i store my tube cap up and i still feel like a lot of product gets lostwasted inside the cap. i like that its water resistant although i probably wouldnt wear it to the beach or pool bc spf 30 is a bit low but its definitely not rubproof ive blown my nose and seen product on the tissue but ive never really found a product thats noseblowing resistant. i would never apply a tinted product on my neck out of concern of getting it on my clothes and this is no exception. i have other tinted mineral sunscreens with higher spf so i mostly will use this during the winter and when i only have to go outside for short periods. ive seen people say this is expensive but the price on amazon is reasonable considering ulta is selling these at 27.99 which is more than twice the price of the most expensive shade on amazon 10 on amazon for medium deep right now but also dislike that different shades of skin products are always different prices on amazon  i always seem to be a pricier shade. as long as neutrogena continues to make this ill buy it as its a cheaper alternative to my other tinted mineral sunscreens for days when i dont need a higher spf and can deal with feeling slightly dewygreasy. decent skin tone match for me,horrible allergic reaction chemical sunscreen also

this product has more pigment in it than most foundations ive used. ive got melasmahyperpigmentation that ive been battling for years so its very crucial that i cover my hyperpigmented spots at all times. same time the shade difference between my darker and lighter parts of my face make it really hard to find a good foundation. it either leaves my darker spots painted over in a lighter color or leaves the dreaded line at my jaw. so i have to use something with okay coverage and some dewiness in a color between my two contrasting skin shades.to do this id been using drmtlgy universal tint moisturizer which has spf 46 but the coverage was lacking and its expensive. this was the perfect solution. i start with aveeno maxglow hydrating serumprimer then after that soaks in i apply this. after a couple of minutes i go over my darker hyperpigmented spots with the drmtlgy which has a higher spf and softer glow. then some concealer under eyes and im good to go.caveat  the reason this may work so well for me is likely just luck in that the color sits between my dark and light spots and has a warm peachygolden undertone. i can see how this would not work for someone with darker or lighter skin or someone with a cool pink or neutral olive undertone. or for folks who want to wear additional makeupfoundation over it. lets be honest this is good makeup for certain people moreso than sunscreen,product pigment foundations ive used . ive got melasmahyperpigmentation ive battling years crucial cover hyperpigmented spots times . time shade difference darker lighter parts face make really hard find good foundation . either leaves darker spots painted lighter color leaves dreaded line jaw . use something okay coverage dewiness color two contrasting skin shades.to id using drmtlgy universal tint moisturizer spf 46 coverage lacking expensive . perfect solution . start aveeno maxglow hydrating serumprimer soaks apply . couple minutes go darker hyperpigmented spots drmtlgy higher spf softer glow . concealer eyes im good go.caveat reason may work well likely luck color sits dark light spots warm peachygolden undertone . see would not work someone darker lighter skin someone cool pink neutral olive undertone . folks want wear additional makeupfoundation . lets honest good makeup certain people moreso sunscreen,"['product', 'pigment', 'foundations', 'ive', 'used', '.', 'ive', 'got', 'melasmahyperpigmentation', 'ive', 'battling', 'years', 'crucial', 'cover', 'hyperpigmented', 'spots', 'times', '.', 'time', 'shade', 'difference', 'darker', 'lighter', 'parts', 'face', 'make', 'really', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'foundation', '.', 'either', 'leaves', 'darker', 'spots', 'painted', 'lighter', 'color', 'leaves', 'dreaded', 'line', 'jaw', '.', 'use', 'something', 'okay', 'coverage', 'dewiness', 'color', 'two', 'contrasting', 'skin', 'shades.to', 'id', 'using', 'drmtlgy', 'universal', 'tint', 'moisturizer', 'spf', '46', 'coverage', 'lacking', 'expensive', '.', 'perfect', 'solution', '.', 'start', 'aveeno', 'maxglow', 'hydrating', 'serumprimer', 'soaks', 'apply', '.', 'couple', 'minutes', 'go', 'darker', 'hyperpigmented', 'spots', 'drmtlgy', 'higher', 'spf', 'softer', 'glow', '.', 'concealer', 'eyes', 'im', 'good', 'go.caveat', 'reason', 'may', 'work', 'well', 'likely', 'luck', 'color', 'sits', 'dark', 'light', 'spots', 'warm', 'peachygolden', 'undertone', '.', 'see', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'someone', 'darker', 'lighter', 'skin', 'someone', 'cool', 'pink', 'neutral', 'olive', 'undertone', '.', 'folks', 'want', 'wear', 'additional', 'makeupfoundation', '.', 'lets', 'honest', 'good', 'makeup', 'certain', 'people', 'moreso', 'sunscreen']"

i have rosacea and i sometimes hate the summer months because of the constant battle between having adequate sun protection plus some kind of makeupcoverage to mask the underlying redness of my skin. over the years ive become more accepting of just foregoing makeup application so long as i can keep the rosacea under control which is the main reason i wear foundation anyways. i was hoping that this sunscreen would be a big game changer for me. in some ways it was the tint was perfect and did not appear too dark on my fair skin and also didnt make me look ghostlike. in fact upon first application i was in love  however as sweat began to accumulate on my skin after being outside in the heathumidity it was like the tint and sunscreen separated and it left my skin looking pasty and the sweat beaded up differently on my skin which made it all too noticeable. i also did not think about how the tint would come off on my towel when i dabbed my face off but i should have known that was going to happen anyways.  as far as the skin protection this sunscreen did its job and i did not burn even after sweating and wiping off most of the product without reapplying. but after i got out into the sun and humidity ie florida in july it left my face looking very strange almost as if i had applied a liquid foundation or something on my face that was about 23 shades too light for my skin tonelooking way worse than it had when i had first applied it that day. nice tint but doesnt blend well,rosacea sometimes hate summer months constant battle adequate sun protection plus kind makeupcoverage mask underlying redness skin . years ive become accepting foregoing makeup application long keep rosacea control main reason wear foundation anyways . hoping sunscreen would big game changer . ways tint perfect not appear dark fair skin also didnt make look ghostlike . fact upon first application love however sweat began accumulate skin outside heathumidity like tint sunscreen separated left skin looking pasty sweat beaded differently skin made noticeable . also not think tint would come towel dabbed face known going happen anyways . far skin protection sunscreen job not burn even sweating wiping product without reapplying . got sun humidity ie florida july left face looking strange almost applied liquid foundation something face 23 shades light skin tonelooking way worse first applied day . nice tint doesnt blend well,"['rosacea', 'sometimes', 'hate', 'summer', 'months', 'constant', 'battle', 'adequate', 'sun', 'protection', 'plus', 'kind', 'makeupcoverage', 'mask', 'underlying', 'redness', 'skin', '.', 'years', 'ive', 'become', 'accepting', 'foregoing', 'makeup', 'application', 'long', 'keep', 'rosacea', 'control', 'main', 'reason', 'wear', 'foundation', 'anyways', '.', 'hoping', 'sunscreen', 'would', 'big', 'game', 'changer', '.', 'ways', 'tint', 'perfect', 'not', 'appear', 'dark', 'fair', 'skin', 'also', 'didnt', 'make', 'look', 'ghostlike', '.', 'fact', 'upon', 'first', 'application', 'love', 'however', 'sweat', 'began', 'accumulate', 'skin', 'outside', 'heathumidity', 'like', 'tint', 'sunscreen', 'separated', 'left', 'skin', 'looking', 'pasty', 'sweat', 'beaded', 'differently', 'skin', 'made', 'noticeable', '.', 'also', 'not', 'think', 'tint', 'would', 'come', 'towel', 'dabbed', 'face', 'known', 'going', 'happen', 'anyways', '.', 'far', 'skin', 'protection', 'sunscreen', 'job', 'not', 'burn', 'even', 'sweating', 'wiping', 'product', 'without', 'reapplying', '.', 'got', 'sun', 'humidity', 'ie', 'florida', 'july', 'left', 'face', 'looking', 'strange', 'almost', 'applied', 'liquid', 'foundation', 'something', 'face', '23', 'shades', 'light', 'skin', 'tonelooking', 'way', 'worse', 'first', 'applied', 'day', '.', 'nice', 'tint', 'doesnt', 'blend', 'well']"

so far so good as far as texture it doesnt pill and plays well with make up. as far as sun protection its too early to tell i havent gone outside with it just yet.  its shinier than what i like so if youre into the dewy look this is for you. what im not so thrilled about it is the amount of product for the price. this thing is tiny. im not sure how many uses im going to get out of it  i will update this later with the number considering the amount one has to put on to get adequate coverage at 40 spf thats about half a teaspoon for the face and neck combined. i guess i could do the math with how much in the bottle and do conversions to get an estimate. maybe ill do that and get an irl final figure and let you know if its worth your money. i also have melasma on my cheeks so im also hoping the iron oxides in this sun screen actually block them from getting darker. ill give you all an update about that too.  i usually buy australian gold tinted sun screenbb cream in fair to light skin but since its out of stock everywhere i was forced to try something new.this particular sunscreen is darker than that and gives me kind of an orangereddish tint but it has iron oxide in it so what would i expect id be willing to have the slight red tint if it meant my melasma doesnt get worse but make up over it does help. i will be back with an update on what i think of this sunscreen overall in a later post but tell me why is it so difficult to find a good tinted sunscreen in your shade ,far good far texture doesnt pill plays well make . far sun protection early tell havent gone outside yet . shinier like youre dewy look . im not thrilled amount product price . thing tiny . im not sure many uses im going get update later number considering amount one put get adequate coverage 40 spf thats half teaspoon face neck combined . guess could math much bottle conversions get estimate . maybe ill get irl final figure let know worth money . also melasma cheeks im also hoping iron oxides sun screen actually block getting darker . ill give update . usually buy australian gold tinted sun screenbb cream fair light skin since stock everywhere forced try something new.this particular sunscreen darker gives kind orangereddish tint iron oxide would expect id willing slight red tint meant melasma doesnt get worse make help . back update think sunscreen overall later post tell difficult find good tinted sunscreen shade,"['far', 'good', 'far', 'texture', 'doesnt', 'pill', 'plays', 'well', 'make', '.', 'far', 'sun', 'protection', 'early', 'tell', 'havent', 'gone', 'outside', 'yet', '.', 'shinier', 'like', 'youre', 'dewy', 'look', '.', 'im', 'not', 'thrilled', 'amount', 'product', 'price', '.', 'thing', 'tiny', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'many', 'uses', 'im', 'going', 'get', 'update', 'later', 'number', 'considering', 'amount', 'one', 'put', 'get', 'adequate', 'coverage', '40', 'spf', 'thats', 'half', 'teaspoon', 'face', 'neck', 'combined', '.', 'guess', 'could', 'math', 'much', 'bottle', 'conversions', 'get', 'estimate', '.', 'maybe', 'ill', 'get', 'irl', 'final', 'figure', 'let', 'know', 'worth', 'money', '.', 'also', 'melasma', 'cheeks', 'im', 'also', 'hoping', 'iron', 'oxides', 'sun', 'screen', 'actually', 'block', 'getting', 'darker', '.', 'ill', 'give', 'update', '.', 'usually', 'buy', 'australian', 'gold', 'tinted', 'sun', 'screenbb', 'cream', 'fair', 'light', 'skin', 'since', 'stock', 'everywhere', 'forced', 'try', 'something', 'new.this', 'particular', 'sunscreen', 'darker', 'gives', 'kind', 'orangereddish', 'tint', 'iron', 'oxide', 'would', 'expect', 'id', 'willing', 'slight', 'red', 'tint', 'meant', 'melasma', 'doesnt', 'get', 'worse', 'make', 'help', '.', 'back', 'update', 'think', 'sunscreen', 'overall', 'later', 'post', 'tell', 'difficult', 'find', 'good', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', 'shade']"

i generally refuse to pay for fancyschmancy products hello fellow drugstore girlies and i resisted the hype. then i saw an independent test in which a line of photosensitive dots was placed on someones arm and each dot was covered with a different sunscreen. la rocheposays protection lasted so much longer than my usual drugstore choice so when amazon had it on sale for 29 i jumped. and darn it this is a fabulous product. it applies supersmoothly and is very lightweight but offers great coverage. it blends like a dream im over 40 and it doesnt settle in or exaggerate my pores. i use it instead of foundation in the summer when my makeup is minimal but you could definitely layer products over it without it pilling. i wish they offered a wider color range for people with darker skin i really hope thats in the works for the diverse world we live in. but for folks with mediumtoned or lighter skin its pretty flexible i had thought it would be too light and too grayishtoned for my olive skin fyi i have nearblack hair and browns dark brown eyes but it melts into my skin well and quickly. when this runs out though i still dont know if i can justify repurchasing unless i get another amazing deal ill probably just use e.l.f. which did ok if not as well in the testing and reapply frequently. sigh. ,generally refuse pay fancyschmancy products hello fellow drugstore girlies resisted hype . saw independent test line photosensitive dots placed someones arm dot covered different sunscreen . la rocheposays protection lasted much longer usual drugstore choice amazon sale 29 jumped . darn fabulous product . applies supersmoothly lightweight offers great coverage . blends like dream im 40 doesnt settle exaggerate pores . use instead foundation summer makeup minimal could definitely layer products without pilling . wish offered wider color range people darker skin really hope thats works diverse world live . folks mediumtoned lighter skin pretty flexible thought would light grayishtoned olive skin fyi nearblack hair browns dark brown eyes melts skin well quickly . runs though still dont know justify repurchasing unless get another amazing deal ill probably use e.l.f . ok not well testing reapply frequently . sigh .,"['generally', 'refuse', 'pay', 'fancyschmancy', 'products', 'hello', 'fellow', 'drugstore', 'girlies', 'resisted', 'hype', '.', 'saw', 'independent', 'test', 'line', 'photosensitive', 'dots', 'placed', 'someones', 'arm', 'dot', 'covered', 'different', 'sunscreen', '.', 'la', 'rocheposays', 'protection', 'lasted', 'much', 'longer', 'usual', 'drugstore', 'choice', 'amazon', 'sale', '29', 'jumped', '.', 'darn', 'fabulous', 'product', '.', 'applies', 'supersmoothly', 'lightweight', 'offers', 'great', 'coverage', '.', 'blends', 'like', 'dream', 'im', '40', 'doesnt', 'settle', 'exaggerate', 'pores', '.', 'use', 'instead', 'foundation', 'summer', 'makeup', 'minimal', 'could', 'definitely', 'layer', 'products', 'without', 'pilling', '.', 'wish', 'offered', 'wider', 'color', 'range', 'people', 'darker', 'skin', 'really', 'hope', 'thats', 'works', 'diverse', 'world', 'live', '.', 'folks', 'mediumtoned', 'lighter', 'skin', 'pretty', 'flexible', 'thought', 'would', 'light', 'grayishtoned', 'olive', 'skin', 'fyi', 'nearblack', 'hair', 'browns', 'dark', 'brown', 'eyes', 'melts', 'skin', 'well', 'quickly', '.', 'runs', 'though', 'still', 'dont', 'know', 'justify', 'repurchasing', 'unless', 'get', 'another', 'amazing', 'deal', 'ill', 'probably', 'use', 'e.l.f', '.', 'ok', 'not', 'well', 'testing', 'reapply', 'frequently', '.', 'sigh', '.']"

i bought this tinted sunscreen for may when we head out for vacation. obviously i had to test it and make sure there wouldnt be an issue with the product as a whole. and there were no issues. i shook the product up and per the instructions. removed the cap and made a thin line on my forehead about 1.5 long. then 1 thin line under each eye and a thin line from my left cheek down to my chin and around to my right cheek. it sounds like a lot but the product is just barely thicker than water. i used my fingers lightly to start smearing the product around quickly covering my jaw and down my neck up to my temple area under my eyes my nose and everywhere it would be visible to others and also to make sure there were no uneven spots or product that got caught in hairs on the sideburn area. then i continued with my forehead and hairline. this product is very similar to another product i used that was made by a company that produces hair products that starts with a g. they stopped producing the tinted sunscreen and went to a cream paste which is greasy and sucks. this product is very thin dries like powder but needs a few minutes to settle in before it really matches your skin tone. im a mix between porcelain and ivory. a little red at times and sometimes look a little colorless. im anemic so my skin tone tends to be a little uneven and often very pale. no powder is required with this. you can use it as regular foundation and continue applying your makeup as usual but i found this product to be light as powder soft on the skin and not cakey. perfect really for light day wear and even ladies that are transitioning from their 30s into their 40s and beyond. i found that this product even allowed my natural rosy cheeks to stand out a little and didnt apply anything except a brown mascara to lightly tint my eyelashes and a lightly tinted chapstick. i was ready in less than 10 minutes. it was nice to have my old routine back. if you have blemishes this would not cover them. im going back to buy more. not only is it great for protecting our skin from the sun but it looks great as makeup.to note i have very sensitive skin. im even on medication for severe psoriasis and it can tend to make your skin sensitive to water temps. trust me it sucks i did not experience any burning rashes or have any issues concerning my skin. this product is very gentle. ,bought tinted sunscreen may head vacation . obviously test make sure wouldnt issue product whole . no issues . shook product per instructions . removed cap made thin line forehead 1.5 long .

im a dermatologist who likes to run sprints as an exercise. ive tested a bunch of sunscreens because so many burn my eyes when i run. my eyes are quite forgiving with this sunscreen. that being said i noticed a few other reviewers whose eyes have burned.  in my opinion they are probably just unlucky to be sensitive to this sunscreen. in short some people will have eyes that burn and some wont. this applies for all sunscreens. youve got to find one that you tolerate. the same rationale applies for rashes or acne.i recommend different sunscreens for different purposes. this one happens to be a little heavy for daily use but it does the job during exercise as well as any that ive tried. in case youre interested i apply it ridiculously thick about 45 minutes before i go out.  i look like a freak around the house but it gets absorbed by the time i step out the door. i recommend reapplying every two hours. for swimmers reapply every 30 minutes if possible because waterproof laboratory testing is done in a bathtub. its a lot different in the pool or the ocean.on the technical side helioplex refers to photostabilization which means that it resists breaking down when the sun hits it. yes you heard rightmany sunscreens break down in sunlightone more word of advice not related to this sunscreen so i can feel im honoring hippocrates and his oath  even the best sunscreens are not perfect in filtering or blocking ultraviolet light. so try to go out after 4 pm in the summer.  or if you prefer get out there at 6 am and be back home by 9 am.  if youre a hiker get a hat with wide rims from sun precautions or another company called sunday afternoons. they also sell shirts that block ultraviolet light and cool you off. i would post their websites but amazon doesnt allow links on these reviews.last thing like all dermatologists i get a bunch of sunscreens for free from manufacturers.  but i buy neutrogena sport face with my own money for my workouts on the track. dermatologist

this sunscreen worked well when we went to a clothing optional beach in 101f weather  neither my husband or i burned at all and i spent most of the time in the water my friend and her husband used a way more expensive brand and both burned.this stuff is thick. it sits on the skin even after being in the water and isnt super easy to get off. the second time i applied it i went back into the water and tried to kind of wash it off of my hands and it wouldnt come off at all so my hands had a visible thick layer on them the entire 2 hours i swam. i even used sand and rubbed my hands  nothing. i finally had to use a baby wipe and then wash with warm water and soap twice in an actual bathroom to get it off but since it was all over my skin it also got all over my husbands brand new car and isnt easy to clean off.we will definitely use it again because the protection was worth it but maybe use it a little more sparingly  i have a tendency to slather it on because i got so burnt last year i had blisters and needed rx burn meds and iv fluids to recover  ,sunscreen worked well went clothing optional beach 101f weather neither husband burned spent time water friend husband used way expensive brand burned.this stuff thick . sits skin even water isnt super easy get . second time applied went back water tried kind wash hands wouldnt come hands visible thick layer entire 2 hours swam . even used sand rubbed hands nothing . finally use baby wipe wash warm water soap twice actual bathroom get since skin also got husbands brand new car isnt easy clean off.we definitely use protection worth maybe use little sparingly tendency slather got burnt last year blisters needed rx burn meds iv fluids recover,"['sunscreen', 'worked', 'well', 'went', 'clothing', 'optional', 'beach', '101f', 'weather', 'neither', 'husband', 'burned', 'spent', 'time', 'water', 'friend', 'husband', 'used', 'way', 'expensive', 'brand', 'burned.this', 'stuff', 'thick', '.', 'sits', 'skin', 'even', 'water', 'isnt', 'super', 'easy', 'get', '.', 'second', 'time', 'applied', 'went', 'back', 'water', 'tried', 'kind', 'wash', 'hands', 'wouldnt', 'come', 'hands', 'visible', 'thick', 'layer', 'entire', '2', 'hours', 'swam', '.', 'even', 'used', 'sand', 'rubbed', 'hands', 'nothing', '.', 'finally', 'use', 'baby', 'wipe', 'wash', 'warm', 'water', 'soap', 'twice', 'actual', 'bathroom', 'get', 'since', 'skin', 'also', 'got', 'husbands', 'brand', 'new', 'car', 'isnt', 'easy', 'clean', 'off.we', 'definitely', 'use', 'protection', 'worth', 'maybe', 'use', 'little', 'sparingly', 'tendency', 'slather', 'got', 'burnt', 'last', 'year', 'blisters', 'needed', 'rx', 'burn', 'meds', 'iv', 'fluids', 'recover']"

the idea of incorporating a matting effect with a tinted spf moisturizer sounded brilliant however whatever ingredientsproperties revision has added to the recipe for the matte version of their intellishade line has had adverse effects at least for me personally.ive tried applying a pea size amount to my skin as well as a generous amount multiple times and throughout the course of 34 weeks and ive never been able to seamlessly apply this moisturizer. it does not properly absorb into my skin leaving a visible amount of residue and film on my skin.the best way to visually describe it is that it genuinely looks like i caked on heavy foundation and powder ran outside on a hot summer day and upon doing so sweat half of my makeup off leaving large strips of tinted residue all over my face. it literally just smears. never absorbs.  ive attempted to apply it faster and slower using varying amounts. i removed my serum from the equation and other topical creams. attempted to apply it with and without my other skincare products.ultimately i am frankly disappointed in this product and it is a real bummer being that i love the original intellishade product. this isnt a 40 dollar moisturizer anymore either. i genuinely hope this product works for the vast majority but i thought it might be helpful to those who have oily acne prone skin in their late 20s and early 30s im caucasian with olive skin to read this. maybe test it out before you buy. tried the matte this time around for my oil prone skin. does not work with my skin at all.,idea incorporating matting effect tinted spf moisturizer sounded brilliant however whatever ingredientsproperties revision added recipe matte version intellishade line adverse effects least personally.ive tried applying pea size amount skin well generous amount multiple times throughout course 34 weeks ive never able seamlessly apply moisturizer . not properly absorb skin leaving visible amount residue film skin.the best way visually describe genuinely looks like caked heavy foundation powder ran outside hot summer day upon sweat half makeup leaving large strips tinted residue face . literally smears . never absorbs . ive attempted apply faster slower using varying amounts . removed serum equation topical creams . attempted apply without skincare products.ultimately frankly disappointed product real bummer love original intellishade product . isnt 40 dollar moisturizer anymore either . genuinely hope product works vast majority thought might helpful oily acne prone skin late 20s early 30s im caucasian olive skin read . maybe test buy . tried matte time around oil prone skin . not work skin .,"['idea', 'incorporating', 'matting', 'effect', 'tinted', 'spf', 'moisturizer', 'sounded', 'brilliant', 'however', 'whatever', 'ingredientsproperties', 'revision', 'added', 'recipe', 'matte', 'version', 'intellishade', 'line', 'adverse', 'effects', 'least', 'personally.ive', 'tried', 'applying', 'pea', 'size', 'amount', 'skin', 'well', 'generous', 'amount', 'multiple', 'times', 'throughout', 'course', '34', 'weeks', 'ive', 'never', 'able', 'seamlessly', 'apply', 'moisturizer', '.', 'not', 'properly', 'absorb', 'skin', 'leaving', 'visible', 'amount', 'residue', 'film', 'skin.the', 'best', 'way', 'visually', 'describe', 'genuinely', 'looks', 'like', 'caked', 'heavy', 'foundation', 'powder', 'ran', 'outside', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'upon', 'sweat', 'half', 'makeup', 'leaving', 'large', 'strips', 'tinted', 'residue', 'face', '.', 'literally', 'smears', '.', 'never', 'absorbs', '.', 'ive', 'attempted', 'apply', 'faster', 'slower', 'using', 'varying', 'amounts', '.', 'removed', 'serum', 'equation', 'topical', 'creams', '.', 'attempted', 'apply', 'without', 'skincare', 'products.ultimately', 'frankly', 'disappointed', 'product', 'real', 'bummer', 'love', 'original', 'intellishade', 'product', '.', 'isnt', '40', 'dollar', 'moisturizer', 'anymore', 'either', '.', 'genuinely', 'hope', 'product', 'works', 'vast', 'majority', 'thought', 'might', 'helpful', 'oily', 'acne', 'prone', 'skin', 'late', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'im', 'caucasian', 'olive', 'skin', 'read', '.', 'maybe', 'test', 'buy', '.', 'tried', 'matte', 'time', 'around', 'oil', 'prone', 'skin', '.', 'not', 'work', 'skin', '.']"

okay let me start off by saying my face seems to break out with anything and everything. i have been battling scars chickenpox all over my face in 7th grade and acne since 7th grade. so i was so excited when finally at the age of 26 my face and complexion were clearer. i went a couple of months without a breakout and all my scars were faded. i decided i wanted to try and go without makeup and came upon this product. besides being greasy upon putting it on easily fixed with a translucent powder my face looked awesome. it was glowing and my complexion looked brighter. but after a couple of uses i noticed my pores were extremely clogged and then my face started breaking out again. i stopped using it and my face cleared up again started using it again and the same thing started to happen with my face. i cant blame it all on this product though thank you genes but i can say that it did contribute to my face breaking out again and that maybe it isnt meant for people who break out easily. but it did make my face look great while it lasted i had high hopes,okay let start saying face seems break anything everything . battling scars chickenpox face 7th grade acne since 7th grade . excited finally age 26 face complexion clearer . went couple months without breakout scars faded . decided wanted try go without makeup came upon product . besides greasy upon putting easily fixed translucent powder face looked awesome . glowing complexion looked brighter . couple uses noticed pores extremely clogged face started breaking . stopped using face cleared started using thing started happen face . cant blame product though thank genes say contribute face breaking maybe isnt meant people break easily . make face look great lasted high hopes,"['okay', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'face', 'seems', 'break', 'anything', 'everything', '.', 'battling', 'scars', 'chickenpox', 'face', '7th', 'grade', 'acne', 'since', '7th', 'grade', '.', 'excited', 'finally', 'age', '26', 'face', 'complexion', 'clearer', '.', 'went', 'couple', 'months', 'without', 'breakout', 'scars', 'faded', '.', 'decided', 'wanted', 'try', 'go', 'without', 'makeup', 'came', 'upon', 'product', '.', 'besides', 'greasy', 'upon', 'putting', 'easily', 'fixed', 'translucent', 'powder', 'face', 'looked', 'awesome', '.', 'glowing', 'complexion', 'looked', 'brighter', '.', 'couple', 'uses', 'noticed', 'pores', 'extremely', 'clogged', 'face', 'started', 'breaking', '.', 'stopped', 'using', 'face', 'cleared', 'started', 'using', 'thing', 'started', 'happen', 'face', '.', 'cant', 'blame', 'product', 'though', 'thank', 'genes', 'say', 'contribute', 'face', 'breaking', 'maybe', 'isnt', 'meant', 'people', 'break', 'easily', '.', 'make', 'face', 'look', 'great', 'lasted', 'high', 'hopes']"

i ordered this sunscreen because im postmenopause and have very dry skin.  im very fair with freckles and burn easily out in the sun.  also im 70 years old and have very thin skin.  for me personally this product does not have enough appreciable moisturizer to be categorize as such.  the color of the tint is a little too dark for me.  having said that i can probably use it during these hot summer months but not in the winter.  i didnt want to return it so im mixing it with my moisturizer.  a small pea size goes a long way so it will last a long time. i like the spf 45 and feel confident that im getting enough sun protection.  however i will not buy it again.  the reviews were very good so i took a chance.  that being said it is a good product just not for me and my needs. ,ordered sunscreen im postmenopause dry skin . im fair freckles burn easily sun . also im 70 years old thin skin . personally product not enough appreciable moisturizer categorize . color tint little dark . said probably use hot summer months not winter . didnt want return im mixing moisturizer . small pea size goes long way last long time . like spf 45 feel confident im getting enough sun protection . however not buy . reviews good took chance . said good product not needs .,"['ordered', 'sunscreen', 'im', 'postmenopause', 'dry', 'skin', '.', 'im', 'fair', 'freckles', 'burn', 'easily', 'sun', '.', 'also', 'im', '70', 'years', 'old', 'thin', 'skin', '.', 'personally', 'product', 'not', 'enough', 'appreciable', 'moisturizer', 'categorize', '.', 'color', 'tint', 'little', 'dark', '.', 'said', 'probably', 'use', 'hot', 'summer', 'months', 'not', 'winter', '.', 'didnt', 'want', 'return', 'im', 'mixing', 'moisturizer', '.', 'small', 'pea', 'size', 'goes', 'long', 'way', 'last', 'long', 'time', '.', 'like', 'spf', '45', 'feel', 'confident', 'im', 'getting', 'enough', 'sun', 'protection', '.', 'however', 'not', 'buy', '.', 'reviews', 'good', 'took', 'chance', '.', 'said', 'good', 'product', 'not', 'needs', '.']"

update 3 starsi really wanted to love this sunscreen  i was too quick to praise this product. it actually does leave a white cast. given the fact that this is a chemical sunscreen i assume the white cast comes from the high amount of silica in it literally the second ingredient on the list. it also contributes to significant drying out of my skin throughout the day. i specifically looked for a product formulated with silica to avoid the greasiness of sunscreens. less silica would likely result in a much better product without compromising on the matte effect. i also started noticing some pilling depending on what products i use underneath.original review 5 starsits really weightless and makes my skin feel soft without the typical greasiness of sunscreens. ive tested out so many sunscreens and this one is the winner for me while others may have better ingredients i can use this one without feeling selfconscious about the shine on my face. the best sunscreen for you is the one you use  and this is it for me it would be perfect if it had green tea extract like the oil free spf serum the serum contains acohol denat which is why i cannot use it. love how it feels on my skin,update 3 starsi really wanted love sunscreen quick praise product . actually leave white cast . given fact chemical sunscreen assume white cast comes high amount silica literally second ingredient list . also contributes significant drying skin throughout day . specifically looked product formulated silica avoid greasiness sunscreens . less silica would likely result much better product without compromising matte effect . also started noticing pilling depending products use underneath.original review 5 starsits really weightless makes skin feel soft without typical greasiness sunscreens . ive tested many sunscreens one winner others may better ingredients use one without feeling selfconscious shine face . best sunscreen one use would perfect green tea extract like oil free spf serum serum contains acohol denat not use . love feels skin,"['update', '3', 'starsi', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'sunscreen', 'quick', 'praise', 'product', '.', 'actually', 'leave', 'white', 'cast', '.', 'given', 'fact', 'chemical', 'sunscreen', 'assume', 'white', 'cast', 'comes', 'high', 'amount', 'silica', 'literally', 'second', 'ingredient', 'list', '.', 'also', 'contributes', 'significant', 'drying', 'skin', 'throughout', 'day', '.', 'specifically', 'looked', 'product', 'formulated', 'silica', 'avoid', 'greasiness', 'sunscreens', '.', 'less', 'silica', 'would', 'likely', 'result', 'much', 'better', 'product', 'without', 'compromising', 'matte', 'effect', '.', 'also', 'started', 'noticing', 'pilling', 'depending', 'products', 'use', 'underneath.original', 'review', '5', 'starsits', 'really', 'weightless', 'makes', 'skin', 'feel', 'soft', 'without', 'typical', 'greasiness', 'sunscreens', '.', 'ive', 'tested', 'many', 'sunscreens', 'one', 'winner', 'others', 'may', 'better', 'ingredients', 'use', 'one', 'without', 'feeling', 'selfconscious', 'shine', 'face', '.', 'best', 'sunscreen', 'one', 'use', 'would', 'perfect', 'green', 'tea', 'extract', 'like', 'oil', 'free', 'spf', 'serum', 'serum', 'contains', 'acohol', 'denat', 'not', 'use', '.', 'love', 'feels', 'skin']"

what i do like about this is the high spf but the texture of the cream felt almost gritty. it seemed to rub in well but it definitely leaves an almost powdery finish on the skin. im very pale skinned and i felt it even gave me a slightly whiter tinge especially in fine lines and under eye creases. its a matte finish not dewy whatsoever.my makeup sat quite well over the top  no pilling which is always a good thing when working with a higher spf. however my skin felt super dry and tight and washing my face at the end of the day revealed dryer skin than normal.i have normal to combination skin for reference but usually after applying higher spf creams and make up i can get oily throughout the day  thats why i tried this product. i feel that this would suit a more naturally oily skin. if youve got any slight dryness anywhere i think this could exacerbate it.probably a great product on the right skin. just not for me. drying and a bit gritty,like high spf texture cream felt almost gritty . seemed rub well definitely leaves almost powdery finish skin . im pale skinned felt even gave slightly whiter tinge especially fine lines eye creases . matte finish not dewy whatsoever.my makeup sat quite well top no pilling always good thing working higher spf . however skin felt super dry tight washing face end day revealed dryer skin normal.i normal combination skin reference usually applying higher spf creams make get oily throughout day thats tried product . feel would suit naturally oily skin . youve got slight dryness anywhere think could exacerbate it.probably great product right skin . not . drying bit gritty,"['like', 'high', 'spf', 'texture', 'cream', 'felt', 'almost', 'gritty', '.', 'seemed', 'rub', 'well', 'definitely', 'leaves', 'almost', 'powdery', 'finish', 'skin', '.', 'im', 'pale', 'skinned', 'felt', 'even', 'gave', 'slightly', 'whiter', 'tinge', 'especially', 'fine', 'lines', 'eye', 'creases', '.', 'matte', 'finish', 'not', 'dewy', 'whatsoever.my', 'makeup', 'sat', 'quite', 'well', 'top', 'no', 'pilling', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'working', 'higher', 'spf', '.', 'however', 'skin', 'felt', 'super', 'dry', 'tight', 'washing', 'face', 'end', 'day', 'revealed', 'dryer', 'skin', 'normal.i', 'normal', 'combination', 'skin', 'reference', 'usually', 'applying', 'higher', 'spf', 'creams', 'make', 'get', 'oily', 'throughout', 'day', 'thats', 'tried', 'product', '.', 'feel', 'would', 'suit', 'naturally', 'oily', 'skin', '.', 'youve', 'got', 'slight', 'dryness', 'anywhere', 'think', 'could', 'exacerbate', 'it.probably', 'great', 'product', 'right', 'skin', '.', 'not', '.', 'drying', 'bit', 'gritty']"

overall i really like this sunscreen. i think it offers excellent protection while making my skin feel better overall after ive been using it for a while. i havent noticed any issues with my skin or reactions. i cant say whether or not it has a white cast since im so pale you wouldnt even notice. it does have a glowy to greasy finish that can settle over time. i havent noticed much pilling under makeup but to be fair i do not use a heavy foundation and apply gently with a sponge so it may not be that way for everyone.the only thing i dont love about this is that after application it will spread into the skin like most products but goes quite far. if i dont have aquaphor or lip balm on when applying this i will taste the sunscreen on my lips in about an hour and it takes a long time to go away. as long as you are careful around your eyes and mouth i do think its a good sunscreen. great protection can spread after application,overall really like sunscreen . think offers excellent protection making skin feel better overall ive using . havent noticed issues skin reactions . cant say whether not white cast since im pale wouldnt even notice . glowy greasy finish settle time . havent noticed much pilling makeup fair not use heavy foundation apply gently sponge may not way everyone.the thing dont love application spread skin like products goes quite far . dont aquaphor lip balm applying taste sunscreen lips hour takes long time go away . long careful around eyes mouth think good sunscreen . great protection spread application,"['overall', 'really', 'like', 'sunscreen', '.', 'think', 'offers', 'excellent', 'protection', 'making', 'skin', 'feel', 'better', 'overall', 'ive', 'using', '.', 'havent', 'noticed', 'issues', 'skin', 'reactions', '.', 'cant', 'say', 'whether', 'not', 'white', 'cast', 'since', 'im', 'pale', 'wouldnt', 'even', 'notice', '.', 'glowy', 'greasy', 'finish', 'settle', 'time', '.', 'havent', 'noticed', 'much', 'pilling', 'makeup', 'fair', 'not', 'use', 'heavy', 'foundation', 'apply', 'gently', 'sponge', 'may', 'not', 'way', 'everyone.the', 'thing', 'dont', 'love', 'application', 'spread', 'skin', 'like', 'products', 'goes', 'quite', 'far', '.', 'dont', 'aquaphor', 'lip', 'balm', 'applying', 'taste', 'sunscreen', 'lips', 'hour', 'takes', 'long', 'time', 'go', 'away', '.', 'long', 'careful', 'around', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'think', 'good', 'sunscreen', '.', 'great', 'protection', 'spread', 'application']"

i really like this product. it goes on smoothly doesnt leave a white cast i have brown skin and dries beautifully. after it settles into the skin it feels like you have nothing on it isnt greasy nor shiny but still leaves the skin feeling nice and hydrated. it also doesnt leave the face smelling like anything. it does smell like sunscreen upon application but it goes away pretty fast. ive been using it everyday for about 3 weeks and i havent had a single breakout. thats a win because i purchased it based on that claim. i havent used it with makeup on top to see if it peels but i have put on some liquid blush on top and it goes on normally.my only complain about this product is how bad it hurts if it gets in your eyes. i put it on my eyelids because every part of your face should be protected right. it isnt during the application that it gets in my eyes ive never had that problem. the issue begins later in the day where the product gets in my eyes by sweating rubbing or crying. and it stings horribly. i dont think it makes my eyes look red and it doesnt affect my vision it just hurts really bad and makes me tear up. so what ive been doing to prevent this is not applying the product too heavily in that area and if i feel some of it is gonna get in my eye i wipe the area with some tissue.it would be the perfect sunscreen if it wasnt for this issue. i wish i wouldnt have to work around it. however for the price i think i would buy it again. ,really like product . goes smoothly doesnt leave white cast brown skin dries beautifully . settles skin feels like nothing isnt greasy nor shiny still leaves skin feeling nice hydrated . also doesnt leave face smelling like anything . smell like sunscreen upon application goes away pretty fast . ive using everyday 3 weeks havent single breakout . thats win purchased based claim . havent used makeup top see peels put liquid blush top goes normally.my complain product bad hurts gets eyes . put eyelids every part face protected right . isnt application gets eyes ive never problem . issue begins later day product gets eyes sweating rubbing crying . stings horribly . dont think makes eyes look red doesnt affect vision hurts really bad makes tear . ive prevent not applying product heavily area feel gon na get eye wipe area tissue.it would perfect sunscreen wasnt issue . wish wouldnt work around . however price think would buy .,"['really', 'like', 'product', '.', 'goes', 'smoothly', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'white', 'cast', 'brown', 'skin', 'dries', 'beautifully', '.', 'settles', 'skin', 'feels', 'like', 'nothing', 'isnt', 'greasy', 'nor', 'shiny', 'still', 'leaves', 'skin', 'feeling', 'nice', 'hydrated', '.', 'also', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'face', 'smelling', 'like', 'anything', '.', 'smell', 'like', 'sunscreen', 'upon', 'application', 'goes', 'away', 'pretty', 'fast', '.', 'ive', 'using', 'everyday', '3', 'weeks', 'havent', 'single', 'breakout', '.', 'thats', 'win', 'purchased', 'based', 'claim', '.', 'havent', 'used', 'makeup', 'top', 'see', 'peels', 'put', 'liquid', 'blush', 'top', 'goes', 'normally.my', 'complain', 'product', 'bad', 'hurts', 'gets', 'eyes', '.', 'put', 'eyelids', 'every', 'part', 'face', 'protected', 'right', '.', 'isnt', 'application', 'gets', 'eyes', 'ive', 'never', 'problem', '.', 'issue', 'begins', 'later', 'day', 'product', 'gets', 'eyes', 'sweating', 'rubbing', 'crying', '.', 'stings', 'horribly', '.', 'dont', 'think', 'makes', 'eyes', 'look', 'red', 'doesnt', 'affect', 'vision', 'hurts', 'really', 'bad', 'makes', 'tear', '.', 'ive', 'prevent', 'not', 'applying', 'product', 'heavily', 'area', 'feel', 'gon', 'na', 'get', 'eye', 'wipe', 'area', 'tissue.it', 'would', 'perfect', 'sunscreen', 'wasnt', 'issue', '.', 'wish', 'wouldnt', 'work', 'around', '.', 'however', 'price', 'think', 'would', 'buy', '.']"

i have both the ultra sheer dry touch spf 55 and the current product the clear face spf 50. they were about the same in appearance both are not shiny at moderate applications. i would consider both to be matte. the clear face did feel a bit more greasysmoother than the ultra sheer but it definitely still is nongreasy and nonoily. it just felt like the ultra sheer had more friction and was more powdery if that makes sense.i did notice that in very heavy applications the ultra sheer would pill more than the clear face and leave a little white cast. when i rubbed the spot with the ultra sheer it started to pill up significantly more than the clear face. however both still did great in not pilling up in general.  if i had to guess i would say that material used in the more powdery and matte feeling in the ultra sheer is the culprit of the increased pilling and whiteness. if you have darker skin or very tanned skin and like to apply a good amount of sunscreen for ease of mind i guess i would advise you to avoid the ultra sheer.the ultra sheer had a twist off cap and flat tip with a hole in the center. this means that it is easy to clean and get all the sunscreen off.with the clear face it has a pop off cap which is still attached allowing for easier one hand use. but this does mean that it is messier as you cant get all sunscreen out of the concave tip. sunscreen builds up on the tip cover as well which is annoying.both sunscreens will sting if they get into your eyes. both also initially leave a tiny bit of a white cast during application but disappear once you rub it in and give it a few minutes to dry down.if you have a costco membership costco has the ultra sheer dry touch 5oz   3 oz for 16 which is more value. i advise you to get that since the differences between the ultra sheer and clear face is negligible. but if i was forced to choose one i would choose the ultra sheer just because of the more cleaner cap.update after weeks of using both i did notice that in moderate applications sometimes the ultra sheer dry touch would sort of pill if i were to disturb the layer enough itching rubbing face. it would be slightly visible and look like white dried sunscreen. i didnt really have this problem with the clear face. i also noticed the ultra sheer dry touch dried out my face more compared to the clear face probably due the more powdery ingredients.update 2 i have then switched to koreanjapanese and abandoned all my us sunscreen including this neutragena one. the asian sunscreens dont sting my eyes are way more cosmetically pleasant i cant tell im wearing sunscreen less drying and some are quite reasonably priced on amazon. there are some out there on amazon or other websites with the sameslightly higher price per gram compared to this neutragena one. i use the skin aqua super moisture gel but the seller and product page is gone on amazon so just look around at various sunscreens and websites. comparing it to the ultra sheer

the environmental working group ewg gives this product a 410 so it is within my acceptable range for a 100 chemical sunscreen.  i have tried many sunscreens mineralbased chemical and others that use a combination.  im now leaning away from mineralbased sunscreens since i cant get used to the chalky white residue which makes you look strange and gets on your clothes and equipment.suncreens like this one from sun bum use chemical sun blockers so they generally are more userfriendly but are not considered as safe as mineralbased sunscreen.  if you or your children are in a vulnerable population then maybe you want to avoid chemical sunscreens in general.  the active ingredients in chemical sunscreens are designed to be absorbed through the skin to do their job but they can also get into your bloodstream and the rest of your body.  this product excludes the two ingredients which have the highest toxicity concerns oxybenzone and octinoxate.  so for me personally i consider it a fair tradeoff between usability and safety.in terms of sun protection my favorite is neutrogena sport face.  it works great but has some bad chemical ingredients and occasionally stings my eyes.  this product does not sting has less potentially harmful ingredients and is reeffriendly.  cons it does not offer the same level of protection spf 50 vs 70 for the neutrogena and does not last as long i do not like the watery consistency and the price at 4.33oz is a little higher than i would prefer to spend. decent chemical sunscreen with less toxicity concerns,environmental working group ewg gives product 410 within acceptable range 100 chemical sunscreen . tried many sunscreens mineralbased chemical others use combination . im leaning away mineralbased sunscreens since cant get used chalky white residue makes look strange gets clothes equipment.suncreens like one sun bum use chemical sun blockers generally userfriendly not considered safe mineralbased sunscreen . children vulnerable population maybe want avoid chemical sunscreens general . active ingredients chemical sunscreens designed absorbed skin job also get bloodstream rest body . product excludes two ingredients highest toxicity concerns oxybenzone octinoxate . personally consider fair tradeoff usability safety.in terms sun protection favorite neutrogena sport face . works great bad chemical ingredients occasionally stings eyes . product not sting less potentially harmful ingredients reeffriendly . cons not offer level protection spf 50 vs 70 neutrogena not last long not like watery consistency price 4.33oz little higher would prefer spend . decent chemical sunscreen less toxicity concerns,"['environmental', 'working', 'group', 'ewg', 'gives', 'product', '410', 'within', 'acceptable', 'range', '100', 'chemical', 'sunscreen', '.', 'tried', 'many', 'sunscreens', 'mineralbased', 'chemical', 'others', 'use', 'combination', '.', 'im', 'leaning', 'away', 'mineralbased', 'sunscreens', 'since', 'cant', 'get', 'used', 'chalky', 'white', 'residue', 'makes', 'look', 'strange', 'gets', 'clothes', 'equipment.suncreens', 'like', 'one', 'sun', 'bum', 'use', 'chemical', 'sun', 'blockers', 'generally', 'userfriendly', 'not', 'considered', 'safe', 'mineralbased', 'sunscreen', '.', 'children', 'vulnerable', 'population', 'maybe', 'want', 'avoid', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', 'general', '.', 'active', 'ingredients', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', 'designed', 'absorbed', 'skin', 'job', 'also', 'get', 'bloodstream', 'rest', 'body', '.', 'product', 'excludes', 'two', 'ingredients', 'highest', 'toxicity', 'concerns', 'oxybenzone', 'octinoxate', '.', 'personally', 'consider', 'fair', 'tradeoff', 'usability', 'safety.in', 'terms', 'sun', 'protection', 'favorite', 'neutrogena', 'sport', 'face', '.', 'works', 'great', 'bad', 'chemical', 'ingredients', 'occasionally', 'stings', 'eyes', '.', 'product', 'not', 'sting', 'less', 'potentially', 'harmful', 'ingredients', 'reeffriendly', '.', 'cons', 'not', 'offer', 'level', 'protection', 'spf', '50', 'vs', '70', 'neutrogena', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'not', 'like', 'watery', 'consistency', 'price', '4.33oz', 'little', 'higher', 'would', 'prefer', 'spend', '.', 'decent', 'chemical', 'sunscreen', 'less', 'toxicity', 'concerns']"

background i ride a bicycle 1014000 miles per year and wear sunscreen every time i go out.  im usually in full sunlight from around 2pm until 6.  i have olive skin and i dont burn easily but i do burn and id rather not look like my skin is heavy leather.i like this product.  the only downside is that the feel takes a bit of time to get used to.  im no longer using neutrogena products because most of them oxybenzone andor retinyl palmitate which may be bad for you the research is inconclusive do your research.  products that avoid those chemicals including this one contain good ol zinc oxide which may have been the first sunscreen and for which there is a boatload of data over 60 years none of it bad.  the problem with zinc oxide is that it is grainy and usually dries solid white.  thinksport has done a very good job of making a zinc oxide based product that avoids the whitewash look of the old style zinc oxide brands.please note that even the fda which warns against excessive use of products containing certain chemicals has said that any sunscreen is better than none.  your choice is your choice.  my choice is this product.pros. zinc oxide is probably the best sunscreen ingredient in terms of long term safe use.conszinc oxide is less comfortable on the skin than the oxybenzone based productszinc oxide brands appear to be a bit less sweat and waterproof than the big brands neutrogena banana boat for example.  i feel like it needs to be reapplied according to the label directions while oxybenzonebased products pretty much coat you like shelac and dont come off at all until you scrub. its zinc oxide but without the chalky whiteness,background ride bicycle 1014000 miles per year wear sunscreen every time go . im usually full sunlight around 2pm 6. olive skin dont burn easily burn id rather not look like skin heavy leather.i like product . downside feel takes bit time get used . im no longer using neutrogena products oxybenzone andor retinyl palmitate may bad research inconclusive research . products avoid chemicals including one contain good ol zinc oxide may first sunscreen boatload data 60 years none bad . problem zinc oxide grainy usually dries solid white . thinksport done good job making zinc oxide based product avoids whitewash look old style zinc oxide brands.please note even fda warns excessive use products containing certain chemicals said sunscreen better none . choice choice . choice product.pros . zinc oxide probably best sunscreen ingredient terms long term safe use.conszinc oxide less comfortable skin oxybenzone based productszinc oxide brands appear bit less sweat waterproof big brands neutrogena banana boat example . feel like needs reapplied according label directions oxybenzonebased products pretty much coat like shelac dont come scrub . zinc oxide without chalky whiteness,"['background', 'ride', 'bicycle', '1014000', 'miles', 'per', 'year', 'wear', 'sunscreen', 'every', 'time', 'go', '.', 'im', 'usually', 'full', 'sunlight', 'around', '2pm', '6.', 'olive', 'skin', 'dont', 'burn', 'easily', 'burn', 'id', 'rather', 'not', 'look', 'like', 'skin', 'heavy', 'leather.i', 'like', 'product', '.', 'downside', 'feel', 'takes', 'bit', 'time', 'get', 'used', '.', 'im', 'no', 'longer', 'using', 'neutrogena', 'products', 'oxybenzone', 'andor', 'retinyl', 'palmitate', 'may', 'bad', 'research', 'inconclusive', 'research', '.', 'products', 'avoid', 'chemicals', 'including', 'one', 'contain', 'good', 'ol', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'may', 'first', 'sunscreen', 'boatload', 'data', '60', 'years', 'none', 'bad', '.', 'problem', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'grainy', 'usually', 'dries', 'solid', 'white', '.', 'thinksport', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'based', 'product', 'avoids', 'whitewash', 'look', 'old', 'style', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'brands.please', 'note', 'even', 'fda', 'warns', 'excessive', 'use', 'products', 'containing', 'certain', 'chemicals', 'said', 'sunscreen', 'better', 'none', '.', 'choice', 'choice', '.', 'choice', 'product.pros', '.', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'probably', 'best', 'sunscreen', 'ingredient', 'terms', 'long', 'term', 'safe', 'use.conszinc', 'oxide', 'less', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'oxybenzone', 'based', 'productszinc', 'oxide', 'brands', 'appear', 'bit', 'less', 'sweat', 'waterproof', 'big', 'brands', 'neutrogena', 'banana', 'boat', 'example', '.', 'feel', 'like', 'needs', 'reapplied', 'according', 'label', 'directions', 'oxybenzonebased', 'products', 'pretty', 'much', 'coat', 'like', 'shelac', 'dont', 'come', 'scrub', '.', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'without', 'chalky', 'whiteness']"

update im no longer as thrilled with this product as i used to be. i find that it leaves a thick feeling on my skin and pills over dry patches easily. the texture is dry which is why i called it matte before but also oily at the same time. i dont know how to explain it other than feeling like a greasy powder. i know its an oxymoron. i suppose its like the sunscreens that claim to be dry touch sunscreens but their always still greasy.it does leave a sheen on my skin which goes away eventually but the texture of the product can still be felt hours later. it doesnt really absorb into the skin which it should since its a chemical not a physical sunscreen. works decently under makeup provided you use a good primer. ive been using the ordinary high adherence silicone primer.originalit is so hard to find a face sunscreen thats cruelty free and vegan. most cf  vegan sunscreens pride themselves on being natural and only containing physical sunscreens like titanium dioxide and non micro zinc. thats all well  good but if your skin is any darker than ghostly white the non micro zinc will leave a white cast. if youre not even a white person then forget about it.im so glad ive found a chemical sunscreen thats cf  vegan and doesnt cost 601 oz. its also very matte for a chemical sunscreen which i like. the bottle says moisturizing but i dont find it very hydrating which is not a problem for me since i have oily skin. if i had dry skin i would probably apply a light moisturizer before this sunscreen and i may need to do so in the winter.the product is very liquidy but not watery. easy to apply but there is a very slight chemicaly smell kinda like paint but only if you deeply inhale. once the sunscreen is applied and you wash your hands it will go away. this is not an issue for me.great product at a great price will definitely order again  again update meh. original finally affordable cruelty free  vegan chemical sunscreen for face,update im no longer thrilled

wanted safe sunscreen for ages grandparents through toddlers. learned about chemically based versus mineral based sunscreens and latest info may 2022 published on thinksport sunscreen shows it to be the best overall so decided to give it a try. it is non nano zinc oxide read up on why that is important and mineral based which is what i have learned is safe for not only us but also the oceans and its in habitants that sunscreens often end up compromising. do your own research on why you want non nano ingredients and not nano in your sunscreen for health reasons and aging your skin reasons. for 5 adults and two young kids a 6 oz tube plus a third of another lasted the 10 days but do know we applied twice daily and used rash guards the other times if necessary. the tint based thinksport was perfect for our faces and left them dewy clear and not white would have used more of the regular untinted for faces if did not have the tinted option. if that is an issue for you get the tinted for your whole body but my research and our experience showed me thinksport leaves you less white than other non nano zinc oxide brands and we could not notice it much if at all after rubbing it in. these products worked extremely well for us researched well and scored big for our family with thinksport,wanted safe sunscreen ages grandparents toddlers . learned chemically based versus mineral based sunscreens latest info may 2022 published thinksport sunscreen shows best overall decided give try . non nano zinc oxide read important mineral based learned safe not us also oceans habitants sunscreens often end compromising . research want non nano ingredients not nano sunscreen health reasons aging skin reasons . 5 adults two young kids 6 oz tube plus third another lasted 10 days know applied twice daily used rash guards times necessary . tint based thinksport perfect faces left dewy clear not white would used regular untinted faces not tinted option . issue get tinted whole body research experience showed thinksport leaves less white non nano zinc oxide brands could not notice much rubbing . products worked extremely well us researched well scored big family thinksport,"['wanted', 'safe', 'sunscreen', 'ages', 'grandparents', 'toddlers', '.', 'learned', 'chemically', 'based', 'versus', 'mineral', 'based', 'sunscreens', 'latest', 'info', 'may', '2022', 'published', 'thinksport', 'sunscreen', 'shows', 'best', 'overall', 'decided', 'give', 'try', '.', 'non', 'nano', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'read', 'important', 'mineral', 'based', 'learned', 'safe', 'not', 'us', 'also', 'oceans', 'habitants', 'sunscreens', 'often', 'end', 'compromising', '.', 'research', 'want', 'non', 'nano', 'ingredients', 'not', 'nano', 'sunscreen', 'health', 'reasons', 'aging', 'skin', 'reasons', '.', '5', 'adults', 'two', 'young', 'kids', '6', 'oz', 'tube', 'plus', 'third', 'another', 'lasted', '10', 'days', 'know', 'applied', 'twice', 'daily', 'used', 'rash', 'guards', 'times', 'necessary', '.', 'tint', 'based', 'thinksport', 'perfect', 'faces', 'left', 'dewy', 'clear', 'not', 'white', 'would', 'used', 'regular', 'untinted', 'faces', 'not', 'tinted', 'option', '.', 'issue', 'get', 'tinted', 'whole', 'body', 'research', 'experience', 'showed', 'thinksport', 'leaves', 'less', 'white', 'non', 'nano', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'brands', 'could', 'not', 'notice', 'much', 'rubbing', '.', 'products', 'worked', 'extremely', 'well', 'us', 'researched', 'well', 'scored', 'big', 'family', 'thinksport']"

i will start with saying this product did seem to protect me from getting a sunburn. i was only in uv of 5 at the highest so it may not have necessarily been because of the sunscreen. it was as you would expect for a mineral sunscreen in terms of having to rub it in more to not leave a white residue. however i was so greasy that it got all over my leather seats and had to scrub it off still hasnt come off the seats all the way. once i got wet i had white stripes everyone on me and had to rub the sunscreen in again. i took two showers and still could not be all the sunscreen off it was so unpleasant feeling like my skin couldnt breathe and couldnt get it off. it does the job but would recommend a different mineral sunscreen before this one. hard to get off leaves white residue,start saying product seem protect getting sunburn . uv 5 highest may not necessarily sunscreen . would expect mineral sunscreen terms rub not leave white residue . however greasy got leather seats scrub still hasnt come seats way . got wet white stripes everyone rub sunscreen . took two showers still could not sunscreen unpleasant feeling like skin couldnt breathe couldnt get . job would recommend different mineral sunscreen one . hard get leaves white residue,"['start', 'saying', 'product', 'seem', 'protect', 'getting', 'sunburn', '.', 'uv', '5', 'highest', 'may', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sunscreen', '.', 'would', 'expect', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'terms', 'rub', 'not', 'leave', 'white', 'residue', '.', 'however', 'greasy', 'got', 'leather', 'seats', 'scrub', 'still', 'hasnt', 'come', 'seats', 'way', '.', 'got', 'wet', 'white', 'stripes', 'everyone', 'rub', 'sunscreen', '.', 'took', 'two', 'showers', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'sunscreen', 'unpleasant', 'feeling', 'like', 'skin', 'couldnt', 'breathe', 'couldnt', 'get', '.', 'job', 'would', 'recommend', 'different', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'one', '.', 'hard', 'get', 'leaves', 'white', 'residue']"
i burn at the thought of a sunny day and especially since i went bald summer days are not a fun combo. i went specifically looking for a sunscreen that would work to keep my head less than strawberry red every day and stick around when i started to sweat and this is what i found. ive had it for the last two summers and ive been extremely impressed with how well it has worked.the negative of it is simply that its like putting on yogurt the stuff is thick but it works. ive found the most effective solution is to get small amounts rub it in my hands for a second then apply it. otherwise you spend 5 minutes trying to work it into your skin and you look like casper the ghost especially if it gets in your hair beard eyebrows arm hairs etc.this may just be a personal thing i sweat pretty dang easily too but once i put it on i do find my head sweats even more so i try to put on the sunscreen and stay in an air conditioned place for at least 10 minutes before going outside. if i go outside too soon it just sweats off immediately and then im sol. again thats probably more of a personal thing but something to keep in mind. once its on though it sticks around and keeps me protected through lawn mowing days at the beach or riding the bicycles.i just spent two days by the gulf of mexico in florida and was out in direct sunlight on the water both days. normally thats a recipe for aloe vera and pain for me but with thinksport i actually survived. i will never take that for granted. i searched for something to protect my bald head and this did it,burn thought sunny day especially since went bald summer days not fun combo . went specifically looking sunscreen would work keep head less strawberry red every day stick around started sweat found . ive last two summers ive extremely impressed well worked.the negative simply like putting yogurt stuff thick works . ive found effective solution get small amounts rub hands second apply . otherwise spend 5 minutes trying work skin look like casper ghost especially gets hair beard eyebrows arm hairs etc.this may personal thing sweat pretty dang easily put find head sweats even try put sunscreen stay air conditioned place least 10 minutes going outside . go outside soon sweats immediately im sol . thats probably personal thing something keep mind . though sticks around keeps protected lawn mowing days beach riding bicycles.i spent two days gulf mexico florida direct sunlight water days . normally thats recipe aloe vera pain thinksport actually survived . never take granted . searched something protect bald head,"['burn', 'thought', 'sunny', 'day', 'especially', 'since', 'went', 'bald', 'summer', 'days', 'not', 'fun', 'combo', '.', 'went', 'specifically', 'looking', 'sunscreen', 'would', 'work', 'keep', 'head', 'less', 'strawberry', 'red', 'every', 'day', 'stick', 'around', 'started', 'sweat', 'found', '.', 'ive', 'last', 'two', 'summers', 'ive', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'well', 'worked.the', 'negative', 'simply', 'like', 'putting', 'yogurt', 'stuff', 'thick', 'works', '.', 'ive', 'found', 'effective', 'solution', 'get', 'small', 'amounts', 'rub', 'hands', 'second', 'apply', '.', 'otherwise', 'spend', '5', 'minutes', 'trying', 'work', 'skin', 'look', 'like', 'casper', 'ghost', 'especially', 'gets', 'hair', 'beard', 'eyebrows', 'arm', 'hairs', 'etc.this', 'may', 'personal', 'thing', 'sweat', 'pretty', 'dang', 'easily', 'put', 'find', 'head', 'sweats', 'even', 'try', 'put', 'sunscreen', 'stay', 'air', 'conditioned', 'place', 'least', '10', 'minutes', 'going', 'outside', '.', 'go', 'outside', 'soon', 'sweats', 'immediately', 'im', 'sol', '.', 'thats', 'probably', 'personal', 'thing', 'something', 'keep', 'mind', '.', 'though', 'sticks', 'around', 'keeps', 'protected', 'lawn', 'mowing', 'days', 'beach', 'riding', 'bicycles.i', 'spent', 'two', 'days', 'gulf', 'mexico', 'florida', 'direct', 'sunlight', 'water', 'days', '.', 'normally', 'thats', 'recipe', 'aloe', 'vera', 'pain', 'thinksport', 'actually', 'survived', '.', 'never', 'take', 'granted', '.', 'searched', 'something', 'protect', 'bald', 'head']"

i bought this sunscreen to go snorkeling in key largo. they told us we needed reef safe sunscreen and that this was a great one so i got it. i also loved that its non toxic unlike other sunscreens. i used it snorkeling without any issues i didnt burn at all and i continued to use this sunscreen for the remainder of my 3 day trip. over the course of those 3 days we went kayaking lots of walking around in the sun and we went on an airboat through the everglades so as you can imagine i had this sunscreen on every day all over my arms and legs and especially my face which i reapplied as needed. i didnt notice right away that there was an issue i just started to slowly notice that my skin was extremely dry. after a hot shower was the worst my skin was so dry and itchy i had to put on a ton of lotion and it never seemed like enough. i thought maybe it was the salt water and just being in the sun more than what i was used to. but by day 3 my skin was so bad and i was absolutely miserable. finally i realized it was the sunscreen. it was the only new product i put on my skin. everywhere i applied it was dry and itchy. my face was the worst of it it felt like sandpaper to the touch which its never felt like that in my life and it was inflamed. i shouldve known better than to try a new product on a vacation without seeing how it would react to my skin. but i dont have sensitive skin nor have i had any allergies to anything before. this is generally a very safe sunscreen from what ive read but i did see that sometimes people have an allergy to zinc. it took a whole week for my skin to heal from this. had to take colloidal oat baths and use lots of oils to finally get relief. i wont be using this sunscreen again unfortunately. im only giving some stars because it did the job and i didnt get sunburned despite all this. i would recommend testing this out on a small area of skin first before you put it all over just in case you have a reaction. caused severe dry skin

i have been a longtime user of neutrogena sunscreen and picked this up to try it last year primarily to explore how effective it was given the issues surrounding active ingredients of nonmineral sunscreens.  it works well and has not failed me in any situation thus far.i try to properly use sunscreen i usually apply a bit before i go out in the sun at least a few minutes prior try not to rub it off with clothing or rubbing against stuff  people  etc and rarely reapply except on blistering sunny days in the summer or if i feel my skin beginning to burn in a cloudless 2hour midday sun type situation.  i apply enough to cover the skin though i try not to put on enough to make my skin whitish its a little tough given the mineral nature of this.  i dont mind a little whiteness on the skin it helps reinforce that youve got yourself covered.i have used this in the sun while swimming in a pool with no sun cover while at the beach at amusement parks on walks on full sun days etc.  in all scenarios it worked wonderfully.  i have not used it in situations where i sweat profusely all over only where id sweat on my torso under my clothes.i have validation that it works when i miss a spot by my watchband and that part burns.it definitely will leave white marks on black car interiors if you come in contact.  i am not sure if it leaves a yellow stain on white shirt collars like chemical sunscreen does but if it does it isnt nearly as bad as chemical sunscreen.i use a facespecific sunscreen for my face for now the sun bum face mineral sunscreen works nice  i ordered direct from them so no review here for it so cant comment on whether its good for face protection  eye irritation  etc. works well across multiple types of use,longtime user neutrogena sunscreen picked try last year primarily explore effective given issues surrounding active ingredients nonmineral sunscreens . works well not failed situation thus far.i try properly use sunscreen usually apply bit go sun least minutes prior try not rub clothing rubbing stuff people etc rarely reapply except blistering sunny days summer feel skin beginning burn cloudless 2hour midday sun type situation . apply enough cover skin though try not put enough make skin whitish little tough given mineral nature . dont mind little whiteness skin helps reinforce youve got covered.i used sun swimming pool no sun cover beach amusement parks walks full sun days etc . scenarios worked wonderfully . not used situations sweat profusely id sweat torso clothes.i validation works miss spot watchband part burns.it definitely leave white marks black car interiors come contact . not sure leaves yellow stain white shirt collars like chemical sunscreen isnt nearly bad chemical sunscreen.i use facespecific sunscreen face sun bum face mineral sunscreen works nice ordered direct no review cant comment whether good face protection eye irritation etc . works well across multiple types use,"['longtime', 'user', 'neutrogena', 'sunscreen', 'picked', 'try', 'last', 'year', 'primarily', 'explore', 'effective', 'given', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'active', 'ingredients', 'nonmineral', 'sunscreens', '.', 'works', 'well', 'not', 'failed', 'situation', 'thus', 'far.i', 'try', 'properly', 'use', 'sunscreen', 'usually', 'apply', 'bit', 'go', 'sun', 'least', 'minutes', 'prior', 'try', 'not', 'rub', 'clothing', 'rubbing', 'stuff', 'people', 'etc', 'rarely', 'reapply', 'except', 'blistering', 'sunny', 'days', 'summer', 'feel', 'skin', 'beginning', 'burn', 'cloudless', '2hour', 'midday', 'sun', 'type', 'situation', '.', 'apply', 'enough', 'cover', 'skin', 'though', 'try', 'not', 'put', 'enough', 'make', 'skin', 'whitish', 'little', 'tough', 'given', 'mineral', 'nature', '.', 'dont', 'mind', 'little', 'whiteness', 'skin', 'helps', 'reinforce', 'youve', 'got', 'covered.i', 'used', 'sun', 'swimming', 'pool', 'no', 'sun', 'cover', 'beach', 'amusement', 'parks', 'walks', 'full', 'sun', 'days', 'etc', '.', 'scenarios', 'worked', 'wonderfully', '.', 'not', 'used', 'situations', 'sweat', 'profusely', 'id', 'sweat', 'torso', 'clothes.i', 'validation', 'works', 'miss', 'spot', 'watchband', 'part', 'burns.it', 'definitely', 'leave', 'white', 'marks', 'black', 'car', 'interiors', 'come', 'contact', '.', 'not', 'sure', 'leaves', 'yellow', 'stain', 'white', 'shirt', 'collars', 'like', 'chemical', 'sunscreen', 'isnt', 'nearly', 'bad', 'chemical', 'sunscreen.i', 'use', 'facespecific', 'sunscreen', 'face', 'sun', 'bum', 'face', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'works', 'nice', 'ordered', 'direct', 'no', 'review', 'cant', 'comment', 'whether', 'good', 'face', 'protection', 'eye', 'irritation', 'etc', '.', 'works', 'well', 'across', 'multiple', 'types', 'use']"

update march 12 2019 they changed the formula. i just opened a new tube and noticed that it glided on my face much better. the first ingredient is no longer shea butter but aloe vera gel. argan oil is also added as the third ingredient before shea which makes its more liquid. if any of you see the comment that says its hard to apply thats no longer true. i now can apply it on top of my vitamin c gel. they also add a bunch of antioxidant and plant extracts which help when youre exposed to the sun. at first im a bit worried that my sensitive skin may react to those extract but so far its all good.the differences between the old and new formula1. the new one is much easier to apply but also more oily. you will need a bit of powder on top.2. the new one is less chalky. thus its better for a darker skin tone. however the old one was a better primer if you have a light skin tone.3. the new one no longer contains green tea extract. it was replaced with calendula extract and a bunch of herbal extracts which makes the smell more herbal. this can be good or bad depends on how you like it. im fine with it.overall i prefer the old formula for its superior primer effect and more matt. however my skin seems to like them both equally.update on june 24 2018 this 3 oz tube lasts sooo long. i also like that its not separated into layers like some oil base sunscreen. the tube is not transparent so i cant see how much left. guessing from the weight i think theres still around 14 left after 5 months of daily use on the face. my skin has almost no acne now besides some hormonal monthly acne. will continue to use it for sure orginal review i have a dry yet sensitive and acneprone skin the worst combination ever since my favorite sunscreen was discontinued i have been on a quest to find a replacement for a year. this sunscreen is the first one that has everything im looking for. its moisturizing but has a matt finish. it acts like a primer and blurs my pore. i can easily put powder and concealer on top of it on the day i need to wear a makeup. on the day that i dont need a full coverage i mix in a bit of foundation to color it.the ingredients are full of antioxidant. the first 4 ingredients like zinc shea butter calendula and green tea extract are known acne fighters. i have been using it for just 10 days and the result has exceeded my expectation. not only my pores has gotten smaller but all my inflamed acne has disappeared this has never happened before except when i used 10 benzoyl peroxide which cause my skin redness and flaky so i had to stop using it. my skin now looks very healthy no more redness pimples or dryness.the consif you use vitamin c serum or any gellike moisturizer it tends to peel off when you put this sunscreen on top. i fix it by mixing a drop of argan oil with the serum. if youre not acneprone like me other kitchen oils like olive oil etc. should be fine as well.the reason for this long review is that i hope people will use it more so that babo will not discontinue it. i hope i wont have to search for a new sunscreen again. that was not fun cure my acne. moisturizing but not too oily. perfect,update march 12 2019 changed formula . opened new tube noticed glided face much better . first ingredient no longer shea butter aloe vera gel . argan oil also added third ingredient shea makes liquid . see comment

im happy to have found this sunscreen. most sunscreen products on the market these days contain hormonedisrupting chemicals that can be absorbed into the skin such as avobenzone which is unfortunately fdaapproved. titanium dioxide and zinc oxide cannot be absorbed into the skin nor are they hormone disrupters. if youre interested check out ewgs the trouble with ingredients in sunscreens for more information. after understanding how these chemicals impact human health i stopped using all my other sunscreen products including neutrogena which was definitely amazing under makeup.this bobo sunscreen is thick spreadable and only produces a faint white cast on the skin. before applying any makeup i squeeze a quartersize amount onto my hand spread it evenly across my face and let it set for 1015 minutes before applying any makeup foundation with a foundation brush. i also use loosesetting powder to tamp down the greasiness before applying any powdery products e.g. eye shadow blush etc. before leaving the house i also apply a healthy amount on my neck arms back of my hands and any skin areas exposed to sunlight. its been working very well i dont have any skin reactions to it. its such a gem and a musthave for everyone who goes out to get sun all year round. ewg verified  costeffective  no white cast,im happy found sunscreen . sunscreen products market days contain hormonedisrupting chemicals absorbed skin avobenzone unfortunately fdaapproved . titanium dioxide zinc oxide not absorbed skin nor hormone disrupters . youre interested check ewgs trouble ingredients sunscreens information . understanding chemicals impact human health stopped using sunscreen products including neutrogena definitely amazing makeup.this bobo sunscreen thick spreadable produces faint white cast skin . applying makeup squeeze quartersize amount onto hand spread evenly across face let set 1015 minutes applying makeup foundation foundation brush . also use loosesetting powder tamp greasiness applying powdery products e.g . eye shadow blush etc . leaving house also apply healthy amount neck arms back hands skin areas exposed sunlight . working well dont skin reactions . gem musthave everyone goes get sun year round . ewg verified costeffective no white cast,"['im', 'happy', 'found', 'sunscreen', '.', 'sunscreen', 'products', 'market', 'days', 'contain', 'hormonedisrupting', 'chemicals', 'absorbed', 'skin', 'avobenzone', 'unfortunately', 'fdaapproved', '.', 'titanium', 'dioxide', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'not', 'absorbed', 'skin', 'nor', 'hormone', 'disrupters', '.', 'youre', 'interested', 'check', 'ewgs', 'trouble', 'ingredients', 'sunscreens', 'information', '.', 'understanding', 'chemicals', 'impact', 'human', 'health', 'stopped', 'using', 'sunscreen', 'products', 'including', 'neutrogena', 'definitely', 'amazing', 'makeup.this', 'bobo', 'sunscreen', 'thick', 'spreadable', 'produces', 'faint', 'white', 'cast', 'skin', '.', 'applying', 'makeup', 'squeeze', 'quartersize', 'amount', 'onto', 'hand', 'spread', 'evenly', 'across', 'face', 'let', 'set', '1015', 'minutes', 'applying', 'makeup', 'foundation', 'foundation', 'brush', '.', 'also', 'use', 'loosesetting', 'powder', 'tamp', 'greasiness', 'applying', 'powdery', 'products', 'e.g', '.', 'eye', 'shadow', 'blush', 'etc', '.', 'leaving', 'house', 'also', 'apply', 'healthy', 'amount', 'neck', 'arms', 'back', 'hands', 'skin', 'areas', 'exposed', 'sunlight', '.', 'working', 'well', 'dont', 'skin', 'reactions', '.', 'gem', 'musthave', 'everyone', 'goes', 'get', 'sun', 'year', 'round', '.', 'ewg', 'verified', 'costeffective', 'no', 'white', 'cast']"

i purchased this because of the stellar ingredients.  my friend is a pilot and needs a good clean sunscreen without all the nasty chemicals.  zinc is king when it comes to uv protection.  this product is great because it doesnt create that ghostlike appearance.  the cream disappears and absorbs into your skin creating a nice barrier.  it stays on even if youre in water or if you sweat.  you have to be able to withstand the smell all day. this is not unscented it definitely has a scent. its not a chemical smell per se but just unpleasant.  of course this is purely subjective so i deducted only 1 star. great product  slightly unpleasant scent,purchased stellar ingredients . friend pilot needs good clean sunscreen without nasty chemicals . zinc king comes uv protection . product great doesnt create ghostlike appearance . cream disappears absorbs skin creating nice barrier . stays even youre water sweat . able withstand smell day . not unscented definitely scent . not chemical smell per se unpleasant . course purely subjective deducted 1 star . great product slightly unpleasant scent,"['purchased', 'stellar', 'ingredients', '.', 'friend', 'pilot', 'needs', 'good', 'clean', 'sunscreen', 'without', 'nasty', 'chemicals', '.', 'zinc', 'king', 'comes', 'uv', 'protection', '.', 'product', 'great', 'doesnt', 'create', 'ghostlike', 'appearance', '.', 'cream', 'disappears', 'absorbs', 'skin', 'creating', 'nice', 'barrier', '.', 'stays', 'even', 'youre', 'water', 'sweat', '.', 'able', 'withstand', 'smell', 'day', '.', 'not', 'unscented', 'definitely', 'scent', '.', 'not', 'chemical', 'smell', 'per', 'se', 'unpleasant', '.', 'course', 'purely', 'subjective', 'deducted', '1', 'star', '.', 'great', 'product', 'slightly', 'unpleasant', 'scent']"

ive used thinksport spf 50 for a few years for longexposure days with no complaints. last order was precovid and since i ordered this time from amazon directly and the picture matched what i had previously that i would get exactly that again. instead i received a differently packaged and differently named product orange tube instead of red labeled spf 50 instead of spf 50. however both tubes have identical bar codes. sometimes this kind of thing can be due to regional differences so i went to the companys indicated url which had itself changed to investigate. at this writing thinksport is using both kinds of packaging on their tubes but with both kinds having an accompanying text label spf 50 suggesting that spf 50 is interchangeable with spf 50 and the amazon page lists it as spf 50 as well.however after closer comparison it appears that there was a reformulation. other than slight changes in names and in order of sequence indicating changes of amount following are mutually exclusive different inactive ingredients i came up withold red tube version includes aloe barbadensis leaf juice extract raspberry seed oil cranberry seed oil sorbitan stearate coconut based hydrogenated castor oil ascorbic acid vitamin c glucose oxidase  lactoperoxidase.new orange tube version includes polyglycery4 isosterate sorbitan sesquioleate hexyl laurate caprylhydroxamic acid glyceryl caprylate.the old version had the aloe listed as the second ingredient after water so removing that is a fairly big change im guessing for cost reasons. as for the rest manufacturers of beauty and skin care products shuffle secondary ingredients like a deck of cards so i dont find those differences too concerning. the active ingredient is still labeled as zinc oxide however the label no longer says nonnano but nonnano is still on the website ingredient label lists. whether zinc particle size makes a big difference is something for your own research but i find it strange that its listed on the website but not the new tube.use warnings and directions are still the same. the old red tube claims no paba parabens phthalates bpa oxybenzone avobenzone petroleum dioxane or toxic chemicals as well as a line about being the first sunscreen to pass whole foods premium body care requirements. the new orange tube removes both those lines. both tubes claim no animal testing new orange tube adds vegan and reef friendly logos.tldr ill give the new version a shot and am provisionally rating at 4 stars based on past performance but its definitely a reformulation and thinksport and amazon should acknowledge that its a different product and in their text should use the new product label without the  to reflect that. comparison of thinksport spf 50 to thinksport spf 50,ive

theres nothing wrong with this sunscreen. its sheer not greasy doesnt make my face white never makes me break out etc. i do wish the spf were a little higher but though i love hot sunny weather im not a sun bather so this will do.i found it very difficult to find a sunscreen i could use. i had picked out several which were considerably more expensive but to my dismay they all contained licorice root extract including neutrogena with an spf of 100. i will not put anything on any part of my body that contains licorice root. it is very bad for the heart. some months back i was using a foot cream to prevent fungal infections and i began having attacks of tachycardia which came totally out of the blue. very scary. the problem wasnt my heart. the problem was the licorice root in the foot cream. the day i stopped using it my heartbeat returned to normal. so any sunscreen with licorice root gets a pass from me. licorice root can cause the potassium levels in your blood to drop drastically leading to heart problems. it does help moisturize the skin but not that much and certainly not enough to warrant the risk. all manufacturers of any skin care products should remove it from their lines immediately.so i finally found this sunscreen and to my delight it contained no licorice root extract. its a nice sunscreen its lightweight and gives my skin a dewy look but as i said i do wish the spf were higher. other than that its just about perfect. highly recommended. its fine but wish the spf were higher,theres nothing wrong sunscreen . sheer not greasy doesnt make face white never makes break etc . wish spf little higher though love hot sunny weather im not sun bather do.i found difficult find sunscreen could use . picked several considerably expensive dismay contained licorice root extract including neutrogena spf 100. not put anything part body contains licorice root . bad heart . months back using foot cream prevent fungal infections began attacks tachycardia came totally blue . scary . problem wasnt heart . problem licorice root foot cream . day stopped using heartbeat returned normal . sunscreen licorice root gets pass . licorice root cause potassium levels blood drop drastically leading heart problems . help moisturize skin not much certainly not enough warrant risk . manufacturers skin care products remove lines immediately.so finally found sunscreen delight contained no licorice root extract . nice sunscreen lightweight gives skin dewy look said wish spf higher . perfect . highly recommended . fine wish spf higher,"['theres', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'sunscreen', '.', 'sheer', 'not', 'greasy', 'doesnt', 'make', 'face', 'white', 'never', 'makes', 'break', 'etc', '.', 'wish', 'spf', 'little', 'higher', 'though', 'love', 'hot', 'sunny', 'weather', 'im', 'not', 'sun', 'bather', 'do.i', 'found', 'difficult', 'find', 'sunscreen', 'could', 'use', '.', 'picked', 'several', 'considerably', 'expensive', 'dismay', 'contained', 'licorice', 'root', 'extract', 'including', 'neutrogena', 'spf', '100.', 'not', 'put', 'anything', 'part', 'body', 'contains', 'licorice', 'root', '.', 'bad', 'heart', '.', 'months', 'back', 'using', 'foot', 'cream', 'prevent', 'fungal', 'infections', 'began', 'attacks', 'tachycardia', 'came', 'totally', 'blue', '.', 'scary', '.', 'problem', 'wasnt', 'heart', '.', 'problem', 'licorice', 'root', 'foot', 'cream', '.', 'day', 'stopped', 'using', 'heartbeat', 'returned', 'normal', '.', 'sunscreen', 'licorice', 'root', 'gets', 'pass', '.', 'licorice', 'root', 'cause', 'potassium', 'levels', 'blood', 'drop', 'drastically', 'leading', 'heart', 'problems', '.', 'help', 'moisturize', 'skin', 'not', 'much', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'risk', '.', 'manufacturers', 'skin', 'care', 'products', 'remove', 'lines', 'immediately.so', 'finally', 'found', 'sunscreen', 'delight', 'contained', 'no', 'licorice', 'root', 'extract', '.', 'nice', 'sunscreen', 'lightweight', 'gives', 'skin', 'dewy', 'look', 'said', 'wish', 'spf', 'higher', '.', 'perfect', '.', 'highly', 'recommended', '.', 'fine', 'wish', 'spf', 'higher']"

i actually really loved this product. i liked the smell i liked how lightweight it was and that it didnt leave a white cast on my darker skin. i loved the price point too. however i had to discontinue use as after a few uses it started to burn and left my face feeling hot and flushed. ive never seen my face turn red before i literally didnt think that was possible. i do have sensitive skin so thems the breaks. if it wasnt for the allergy i would love everything about this product. ,actually really loved product . liked smell liked lightweight didnt leave white cast darker skin . loved price point . however discontinue use uses started burn left face feeling hot flushed . ive never seen face turn red literally didnt think possible . sensitive skin thems breaks . wasnt allergy would love everything product .,"['actually', 'really', 'loved', 'product', '.', 'liked', 'smell', 'liked', 'lightweight', 'didnt', 'leave', 'white', 'cast', 'darker', 'skin', '.', 'loved', 'price', 'point', '.', 'however', 'discontinue', 'use', 'uses', 'started', 'burn', 'left', 'face', 'feeling', 'hot', 'flushed', '.', 'ive', 'never', 'seen', 'face', 'turn', 'red', 'literally', 'didnt', 'think', 'possible', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'thems', 'breaks', '.', 'wasnt', 'allergy', 'would', 'love', 'everything', 'product', '.']"

short reviewits affordable and darkskin friendly a rich moisturizing lotion texture lightly fragranced with no white cast. if you have oily skin you dont even need to moisturize beforehand just skip straight to this sunscreen after cleansing. probably wouldnt be the same for people with dry skin. its at first tacky but it dries down to a smooth finish. though this does have a shine to it that leaves your skin with a healthy dewy glow if you have super oily skin like me do follow up with a powder. if not after a couple of hours youll go from glowy to a grease soaked donut.the story i was shocked that the bottle was tinythe size of my hand funny when ive been through this shock at least a hundred times when trying sunscreens from korean and japanese brands but rest assured it does do its job at least for me and is affordable.ive struggled with finding a decent sunscreen for a good year now. ive tried neutrogena clear face baaad breakout biore aqua rich breakout nieva uv super water gel breakout frudiva okay no breakouts but heavily scented thick lotion and left me super shiny hada labo beautiful lightweight texture but made me break outbasically the struggle was real. until i landed on australian gold tinted sunscreen. that stuff is magic keeps me matte and makes my skin look better but the darkest shade has a gray undertone so i have to follow it up with bronzer.this sunscreen is perfect for when i dont want to deal with the hassle of wearing my tinted sunscreen am going out to run a quick errand or when im staying indoors the entire day. the pump is super useful especially if you do the two finger method application method. it comes out a yellowish color but once you rub it in it easily disappears into the skin. at first it feels tacky almost as if youve applied a serum but within 13 minutes it dries down to a smooth finish. it does leave a shine but nothing that a sebum or setting powder cant handle for 45 hours. the big pointer is that so far no breakouts but ive been using this only for two days so ill update this if i see any changes in my skin.im super glad i found this affordable option i was looking at elta md heard it piles especially with makeup so i held back and la roche posay anthelios ultra light but luckily i decided to peak at the more affordable spectrum of sunscreen. as of now this sunscreen is a keeper. lets see how it stands after a week 3 in 1 deal moisturizer sunscreen and no white cast,short reviewits affordable darkskin friendly rich moisturizing lotion texture lightly fragranced no white cast . oily

i use mineral sunscreen everyday. most of the mineral sunscreen leave a white cast so im leaning towards tinted sunscreen now. this one is a very affordable option in this category tinted mineral sunscreen. ive dry sensitive skin which is acne prone too reason for leaning towards only mineral sunscreen. i have tried this many times in different environment.  and yes even the people with dry skin can make this work. my observation is make sure to moisturize the face well 10 minutes before applying this sunscreen. this kind of create a seal so if you have applied moisturizer way before this your skin will feel the tightness. also it gets more dry if im in ac vs outside. so for office days i have to apply something heavier underneath. this does not break me out which is a plus for me. this spread well and in 23 minutes become totally matte. it does not have much coverage on its own but works pretty well to give a smooth look to the skin. my skin is brown mac nc42 and this does not leave any whitecast on me though when ill run out of this i will try their bb cream in tan because that will match me probably a bit better. but if you have oily skin this is probably one of the best. ,use mineral sunscreen everyday . mineral sunscreen leave white cast im leaning towards tinted sunscreen . one affordable option category tinted mineral sunscreen . ive dry sensitive skin acne prone reason leaning towards mineral sunscreen . tried many times different environment . yes even people dry skin make work . observation make sure moisturize face well 10 minutes applying sunscreen . kind create seal applied moisturizer way skin feel tightness . also gets dry im ac vs outside . office days apply something heavier underneath . not break plus . spread well 23 minutes become totally matte . not much coverage works pretty well give smooth look skin . skin brown mac nc42 not leave whitecast though ill run try bb cream tan match probably bit better . oily skin probably one best .,"['use', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'everyday', '.', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'leave', 'white', 'cast', 'im', 'leaning', 'towards', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', '.', 'one', 'affordable', 'option', 'category', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', '.', 'ive', 'dry', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'acne', 'prone', 'reason', 'leaning', 'towards', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', '.', 'tried', 'many', 'times', 'different', 'environment', '.', 'yes', 'even', 'people', 'dry', 'skin', 'make', 'work', '.', 'observation', 'make', 'sure', 'moisturize', 'face', 'well', '10', 'minutes', 'applying', 'sunscreen', '.', 'kind', 'create', 'seal', 'applied', 'moisturizer', 'way', 'skin', 'feel', 'tightness', '.', 'also', 'gets', 'dry', 'im', 'ac', 'vs', 'outside', '.', 'office', 'days', 'apply', 'something', 'heavier', 'underneath', '.', 'not', 'break', 'plus', '.', 'spread', 'well', '23', 'minutes', 'become', 'totally', 'matte', '.', 'not', 'much', 'coverage', 'works', 'pretty', 'well', 'give', 'smooth', 'look', 'skin', '.', 'skin', 'brown', 'mac', 'nc42', 'not', 'leave', 'whitecast', 'though', 'ill', 'run', 'try', 'bb', 'cream', 'tan', 'match', 'probably', 'bit', 'better', '.', 'oily', 'skin', 'probably', 'one', 'best', '.']"
i am a skincare enthusiast so sunscreen is my best friend and i only use spf 50 or greater.  ive tried many almost every brand available in s3ph0ra sunscreens and this the best high spf ive come across for super oily skin.  i use a pea size amount for my face and neck.  one layer leaves a powdery finish zero white cast on my medium skin and stays put all day.  of course one layer of sunscreen is never enough for me.  i spend way too much time  money on skincare for the sun to reverse all my hard work.  with 23 layers it does start to feel claylike but does not look cakey. it might sound uncomfortable to walk around feeling like a light layer of clay is on your face but i take dry clay over oily french fry face any day.  for people who have normal to dry skin i think there may be better sunscreen options with a higher percent of minerals and various finishes. if you are a sunscreen nut like me and have normaldry skin you probably could double up and lay down a chemical sunscreen first then put this one on top as a physical mineral barrier.  for the oily and super oily skin people like me or those who love a matte look the options are pretty limited and this one is the best.  oil breaks down almost everything so its pretty amazing that this sunscreen stays put all day and works really well under make up.  its also waterproof.  will repurchase again. great for super oily skin,skincare enthusiast sunscreen best friend use spf 50 greater . ive tried many almost every brand available s3ph0ra sunscreens best high spf ive come across super oily skin . use pea size amount face neck . one layer leaves powdery finish zero white cast medium skin stays put day . course one layer sunscreen never enough . spend way much time money skincare sun reverse hard work . 23 layers start feel claylike not look cakey . might sound uncomfortable walk around feeling like light layer clay face take dry clay oily french fry face day . people normal dry skin think may better sunscreen options higher percent minerals various finishes . sunscreen nut like normaldry skin probably could double lay chemical sunscreen first put one top physical mineral barrier . oily super oily skin people like love matte look options pretty limited one best . oil breaks almost everything pretty amazing sunscreen stays put day works really well make . also waterproof . repurchase . great super oily skin,"['skincare', 'enthusiast', 'sunscreen', 'best', 'friend', 'use', 'spf', '50', 'greater', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'many', 'almost', 'every', 'brand', 'available', 's3ph0ra', 'sunscreens', 'best', 'high', 'spf', 'ive', 'come', 'across', 'super', 'oily', 'skin', '.', 'use', 'pea', 'size', 'amount', 'face', 'neck', '.', 'one', 'layer', 'leaves', 'powdery', 'finish', 'zero', 'white', 'cast', 'medium', 'skin', 'stays', 'put', 'day', '.', 'course', 'one', 'layer', 'sunscreen', 'never', 'enough', '.', 'spend', 'way', 'much', 'time', 'money', 'skincare', 'sun', 'reverse', 'hard', 'work', '.', '23', 'layers', 'start', 'feel', 'claylike', 'not', 'look', 'cakey', '.', 'might', 'sound', 'uncomfortable', 'walk', 'around', 'feeling', 'like', 'light', 'layer', 'clay', 'face', 'take', 'dry', 'clay', 'oily', 'french', 'fry', 'face', 'day', '.', 'people', 'normal', 'dry', 'skin', 'think', 'may', 'better', 'sunscreen', 'options', 'higher', 'percent', 'minerals', 'various', 'finishes', '.', 'sunscreen', 'nut', 'like', 'normaldry', 'skin', 'probably', 'could', 'double', 'lay', 'chemical', 'sunscreen', 'first', 'put', 'one', 'top', 'physical', 'mineral', 'barrier', '.', 'oily', 'super', 'oily', 'skin', 'people', 'like', 'love', 'matte', 'look', 'options', 'pretty', 'limited', 'one', 'best', '.', 'oil', 'breaks', 'almost', 'everything', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'sunscreen', 'stays', 'put', 'day', 'works', 'really', 'well', 'make', '.', 'also', 'waterproof', '.', 'repurchase', '.', 'great', 'super', 'oily', 'skin']"

so i found about this sunscreen on a youtube review and had to try it. this was about 6 months ago and i have been using it every day since. i have really sensitive skin and this sunscreen is perfect for me doesnt burn my face breaks me out or irritates it spreads easily with the fingers the matte finish is nice and is way cheaper than other mineral tinted sunscreen but if you are going to buy it be aware of1. its not a good sunscreen for the beach or if you spend a lot of time in the sun the amount of minerals on it is too low and if you need to reapply it every 2 hours it layers horribly.  so you will end up with sunburns or a cakey face. if you plan to use it for every day little direct sun time it works.2. smell awful like paint. if this bothers you skip.3. the color. i have fair skin and the color is ok but the undertone is really redorange so be aware if you have yellow undertones. if you have fair to light skin probably it will work on you but for darker skin tones im not so sure. i just wish it came in different tones.4. i agree with other reviews that it is difficult to take off. i usually take with off with a face wash aveeno for sensitive skin but i have to spend more time washing my face than with other sunscreens or products.5. it doesnt look pretty layered with makeup. so if you use foundation every day on top of sunscreen skip.6. it is a little drying. i usually put moisturizer before applying and after taking it off and is ok but if you have really dry skin maybe it is not for you. also it clings to dry patches a little.overall it is still my favorite for the price point  but its not the best sunscreen ever. ,found sunscreen youtube review try . 6 months ago using every day since . really sensitive skin sunscreen perfect doesnt burn face breaks irritates spreads easily fingers matte finish nice way cheaper mineral tinted sunscreen going buy aware of1 . not good sunscreen beach spend lot time sun amount minerals low need reapply every 2 hours layers horribly . end sunburns cakey face . plan use every day little direct sun time works.2 . smell awful like paint . bothers skip.3 . color . fair skin color ok undertone really redorange aware yellow undertones . fair light skin probably work darker skin tones im not sure . wish came different tones.4 . agree reviews difficult take . usually take face wash aveeno sensitive skin spend time washing face sunscreens products.5 . doesnt look pretty layered makeup . use foundation every day top sunscreen skip.6 . little drying . usually put moisturizer applying taking ok really dry skin maybe not . also clings dry patches little.overall still favorite price point not best sunscreen ever .,"['found', 'sunscreen', 'youtube', 'review', 'try', '.', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'using', 'every', 'day', 'since', '.', 'really', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'sunscreen', 'perfect', 'doesnt', 'burn', 'face', 'breaks', 'irritates', 'spreads', 'easily', 'fingers', 'matte', 'finish', 'nice', 'way', 'cheaper', 'mineral', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', 'going', 'buy', 'aware', 'of1', '.', 'not', 'good', 'sunscreen', 'beach', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'sun', 'amount', 'minerals', 'low', 'need', 'reapply', 'every', '2', 'hours', 'layers', 'horribly', '.', 'end', 'sunburns', 'cakey', 'face', '.', 'plan', 'use', 'every', 'day', 'little', 'direct', 'sun', 'time', 'works.2', '.', 'smell', 'awful', 'like', 'paint', '.', 'bothers', 'skip.3', '.', 'color', '.', 'fair', 'skin', 'color', 'ok', 'undertone', 'really', 'redorange', 'aware', 'yellow', 'undertones', '.', 'fair', 'light', 'skin', 'probably', 'work', 'darker', 'skin', 'tones', 'im', 'not', 'sure', '.', 'wish', 'came', 'different', 'tones.4', '.', 'agree', 'reviews', 'difficult', 'take', '.', 'usually', 'take', 'face', 'wash', 'aveeno', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'spend', 'time', 'washing', 'face', 'sunscreens', 'products.5', '.', 'doesnt', 'look', 'pretty', 'layered', 'makeup', '.', 'use', 'foundation', 'every', 'day', 'top', 'sunscreen', 'skip.6', '.', 'little', 'drying', '.', 'usually', 'put', 'moisturizer', 'applying', 'taking', 'ok', 'really', 'dry', 'skin', 'maybe', 'not', '.', 'also', 'clings', 'dry', 'patches', 'little.overall', 'still', 'favorite', 'price', 'point', 'not', 'best', 'sunscreen', 'ever', '.']"
so. i really wanted to like this sunscreen but.ive been looking for a great all mineral sunscreen ever since i had a severe allergic reaction to a chemical sunscreen from a very insta popular brand that people raved about. since then ive decided to go all mineral just to be safe. i read many reviews from different brands and sites and people seemed to really love this particular sunscreen and the fact that it did not leave a white casperesque mask on the face but was also not some odd shade of unflattering orange tint. this tint is a very light neutral tone  suitable for pale to light medium skin with a cooler undertone.so here are my personal thoughts after a few uses. my skin is normal to dry but can get somewhat oily in the t zone at times its moody that way. the sunscreen goes on very nicely and the tint disappears and leaves a smooth satiny feeling on the skin. great right well heres where things shift. after the product dries down it feels sort of like putty sitting on top of your skin. i used the recommended 14 teaspoon around to cover the face and neck area and was very aware of it the whole day  it just sat on the face like a mask. i also tried it with light daytime foundation on top with the result feeling like cake on top of putty. the foundation ended up looking dry and settled into any fines lines. perhaps a more dewy moisture rich foundation would work better. ill have to play around with it.in conclusion the positives are. you do get a lot of product for a decent price and the tint is a good shade. ill keep using it for the summer probably on its own with no other products on top to run errands but this is not the greatest mineral sunscreen for me so ill keep looking elsewhere. ,. really wanted like sunscreen but.ive looking great mineral sunscreen ever since severe allergic reaction chemical sunscreen insta popular brand people raved . since ive decided go mineral safe . read many reviews different brands sites people seemed really love particular sunscreen fact not leave white casperesque mask face also not odd shade unflattering orange tint . tint light neutral tone suitable pale light medium skin cooler undertone.so personal thoughts uses . skin normal dry get somewhat oily zone times moody way . sunscreen goes nicely tint disappears leaves smooth satiny feeling skin . great right well heres things shift . product dries feels sort like putty sitting top skin . used recommended 14 teaspoon around cover face neck area aware whole day sat face like mask . also tried light daytime foundation top result feeling like cake top putty . foundation ended looking dry settled fines lines . perhaps dewy moisture rich foundation would work better . ill play around it.in conclusion positives . get lot product decent price tint good shade . ill keep using summer probably no products top run errands not greatest mineral sunscreen ill keep looking elsewhere .,"['.', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'sunscreen', 'but.ive', 'looking', 'great', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'ever', 'since', 'severe', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'chemical', 'sunscreen', 'insta', 'popular', 'brand', 'people', 'raved', '.', 'since', 'ive', 'decided', 'go', 'mineral', 'safe', '.', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'different', 'brands', 'sites', 'people', 'seemed', 'really', 'love', 'particular', 'sunscreen', 'fact', 'not', 'leave', 'white', 'casperesque', 'mask', 'face', 'also', 'not', 'odd', 'shade', 'unflattering', 'orange', 'tint', '.', 'tint', 'light', 'neutral', 'tone', 'suitable', 'pale', 'light', 'medium', 'skin', 'cooler', 'undertone.so', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'uses', '.', 'skin', 'normal', 'dry', 'get', 'somewhat', 'oily', 'zone', 'times', 'moody', 'way', '.', 'sunscreen', 'goes', 'nicely', 'tint', 'disappears', 'leaves', 'smooth', 'satiny', 'feeling', 'skin', '.', 'great', 'right', 'well', 'heres', 'things', 'shift', '.', 'product', 'dries', 'feels', 'sort', 'like', 'putty', 'sitting', 'top', 'skin', '.', 'used', 'recommended', '14', 'teaspoon', 'around', 'cover', 'face', 'neck', 'area', 'aware', 'whole', 'day', 'sat', 'face', 'like', 'mask', '.', 'also', 'tried', 'light', 'daytime', 'foundation', 'top', 'result', 'feeling', 'like', 'cake', 'top', 'putty', '.', 'foundation', 'ended', 'looking', 'dry', 'settled', 'fines', 'lines', '.', 'perhaps', 'dewy', 'moisture', 'rich', 'foundation', 'would', 'work', 'better', '.', 'ill', 'play', 'around', 'it.in', 'conclusion', 'positives', '.', 'get', 'lot', 'product', 'decent', 'price', 'tint', 'good', 'shade', '.', 'ill', 'keep', 'using', 'summer', 'probably', 'no', 'products', 'top', 'run', 'errands', 'not', 'greatest', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'ill', 'keep', 'looking', 'elsewhere', '.']"

i am skeptical of all sunscreens and moisturizers because my skin is so sensitive. in the past i would use traditional sunscreen on my face which would sometimes sting and other times sweat or rub off near the nosepiece of my sunglasses. over the  years this has caused sun  damage which is very visible. i tried this australian gold botanical sunscreen because i love the other australian gold products and this one seemed to be what i was looking for based on reviews. it was everything i was looking for and more. first of all it goes on so smoothly and a little goes a long way. it feels like nothing on your face. it is not greasy at all and does not shine. the tint was just enough to blend my reddish areas into the rest of my face without looking like foundation. so i put it on and spent several hours in the sun fully expecting it to fail like other sunscreens on my face. i was so surprised because it did not rub or sweat off like other sunscreens and my face looked clean and freshnot made up. i was thrilled so i started experimenting with it as a primer and moisturizer every day. oh my gosh i love it so much . it is great under makeup but what i discovered was that i could put it on and use it as foundation for the summer months adding some eye makeup when i wanted to look a little less casual. i am so glad i found this product because i love it and plan to keep using it indefinitely. the best tinted sunscreenmoisturizerprimer allinone i have ever used,skeptical sunscreens moisturizers skin sensitive . past would use traditional sunscreen face would sometimes sting times sweat rub near nosepiece sunglasses . years caused sun damage visible . tried australian gold botanical sunscreen love australian gold products one seemed looking based reviews . everything looking . first goes smoothly little goes long way . feels like nothing face . not greasy not shine . tint enough blend reddish areas rest face without looking like foundation . put spent several hours sun fully expecting fail like sunscreens face . surprised not rub sweat like sunscreens face looked clean freshnot made . thrilled started experimenting primer moisturizer every day . oh gosh love much . great makeup discovered could put use foundation summer months adding eye makeup wanted look little less casual . glad found product love plan keep using indefinitely . best tinted sunscreenmoisturizerprimer allinone ever used,"['skeptical', 'sunscreens', 'moisturizers', 'skin', 'sensitive', '.', 'past', 'would', 'use', 'traditional', 'sunscreen', 'face', 'would', 'sometimes', 'sting', 'times', 'sweat', 'rub', 'near', 'nosepiece', 'sunglasses', '.', 'years', 'caused', 'sun', 'damage', 'visible', '.', 'tried', 'australian', 'gold', 'botanical', 'sunscreen', 'love', 'australian', 'gold', 'products', 'one', 'seemed', 'looking', 'based', 'reviews', '.', 'everything', 'looking', '.', 'first', 'goes', 'smoothly', 'little', 'goes', 'long', 'way', '.', 'feels', 'like', 'nothing', 'face', '.', 'not', 'greasy', 'not', 'shine', '.', 'tint', 'enough', 'blend', 'reddish', 'areas', 'rest', 'face', 'without', 'looking', 'like', 'foundation', '.', 'put', 'spent', 'several', 'hours', 'sun', 'fully', 'expecting', 'fail', 'like', 'sunscreens', 'face', '.', 'surprised', 'not', 'rub', 'sweat', 'like', 'sunscreens', 'face', 'looked', 'clean', 'freshnot', 'made', '.', 'thrilled', 'started', 'experimenting', 'primer', 'moisturizer', 'every', 'day', '.', 'oh', 'gosh', 'love', 'much', '.', 'great', 'makeup', 'discovered', 'could', 'put', 'use', 'foundation', 'summer', 'months', 'adding', 'eye', 'makeup', 'wanted', 'look', 'little', 'less', 'casual', '.', 'glad', 'found', 'product', 'love', 'plan', 'keep', 'using', 'indefinitely', '.', 'best', 'tinted', 'sunscreenmoisturizerprimer', 'allinone', 'ever', 'used']"

i love everything about this suncreen.with the light tint and matte finish when i wear it i get asked regularly if my skin is just that clear i have mostly oily skin light redness and enlarged pores. this sunscreen combats all of my current issues and makes me feel like a million bucks.i struggled with cystic acne throughout my early adulthood. its under control now but i do have pitted scars and some hyperpignentation left over. this sunscreen smooths out my skin and is the ideal solution for me to keep my skin looking even but natural. it stays on through the whole day with only a slight degradation in my tzone but ive found that reapplying a little bit solves any problems i have with that.it has a light color so obviously thats not ideal for darker skin types.  i found that as someone with medium olive toned skin though adding one small drop of a liquid color adjuster makes all the difference in keeping my face the same color as the rest of my body.  im not sure how well this would work for someone who doesnt have skin that is still in the light range but it does stretch this foundation to including more skin colors. since using this i have stopped using foundation completely. ive had friends with mature skin and others with dry skin try it and it works just as beautifully on them. i would recommend this to anyone hands down. ,love everything suncreen.with light tint matte finish wear get asked regularly skin clear mostly oily skin light redness enlarged pores . sunscreen combats current issues makes feel like million bucks.i struggled cystic acne throughout early adulthood . control pitted scars hyperpignentation left . sunscreen smooths skin ideal solution keep skin looking even natural . stays whole day slight degradation tzone ive found reapplying little bit solves problems that.it light color obviously thats not ideal darker skin types . found someone medium olive toned skin though adding one small drop liquid color adjuster makes difference keeping face color rest body . im not sure well would work someone doesnt skin still light range stretch foundation including skin colors . since using stopped using foundation completely . ive friends mature skin others dry skin try works beautifully . would recommend anyone hands .,"['love', 'everything', 'suncreen.with', 'light', 'tint', 'matte', 'finish', 'wear', 'get', 'asked', 'regularly', 'skin', 'clear', 'mostly', 'oily', 'skin', 'light', 'redness', 'enlarged', 'pores', '.', 'sunscreen', 'combats', 'current', 'issues', 'makes', 'feel', 'like', 'million', 'bucks.i', 'struggled', 'cystic', 'acne', 'throughout', 'early', 'adulthood', '.', 'control', 'pitted', 'scars', 'hyperpignentation', 'left', '.', 'sunscreen', 'smooths', 'skin', 'ideal', 'solution', 'keep', 'skin', 'looking', 'even', 'natural', '.', 'stays', 'whole', 'day', 'slight', 'degradation', 'tzone', 'ive', 'found', 'reapplying', 'little', 'bit', 'solves', 'problems', 'that.it', 'light', 'color', 'obviously', 'thats', 'not', 'ideal', 'darker', 'skin', 'types', '.', 'found', 'someone', 'medium', 'olive', 'toned', 'skin', 'though', 'adding', 'one', 'small', 'drop', 'liquid', 'color', 'adjuster', 'makes', 'difference', 'keeping', 'face', 'color', 'rest', 'body', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'well', 'would', 'work', 'someone', 'doesnt', 'skin', 'still', 'light', 'range', 'stretch', 'foundation', 'including', 'skin', 'colors', '.', 'since', 'using', 'stopped', 'using', 'foundation', 'completely', '.', 'ive', 'friends', 'mature', 'skin', 'others', 'dry', 'skin', 'try', 'works', 'beautifully', '.', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'hands', '.']"
i have very fair sensitive skin with type 1 rosacea. extreme redness cant use chemical sunscreens fragrance is iffy for me too. other tinted mineral sunscreens i tried left a cast didnt have enough pigment to blur imperfections caked and flakes in my dry patches and settled into my fine lines around and under my eyes took a long time to dry down and usually still needed to be powdered over due to a wet face look and never reapplied well later in the day.now this. let me tell you. first smudge on my face i was impressed how it melted into my skin and blurred imperfections. spreads easily. did not settle in any of my fine lines. did not cake or flake on dry patches. no cast the tint was just enough to even my skin tone a bit and cover some of my pink cheeks. it dried down fast and almost matte. but not a dry powdery looking matte. almost like natural skin with the tiniest luster but no wet or oily or shiny look. no scent no irritation survived several hours in the heat cleaning out my car and garage sweating and in the sun. it still looked as good as it did from original application when i came inside. i was even able to reapply a new thin layer right across the top to freshen up. still no caking smearing or smudging on reapplication. its the holy grail and i already bought more finally the holy grail sunscreen,fair sensitive skin type 1 rosacea . extreme redness cant use chemical sunscreens fragrance iffy . tinted mineral sunscreens tried left cast didnt enough pigment blur imperfections caked flakes dry patches settled fine lines around eyes took long time dry usually still needed powdered due wet face look never reapplied well later day.now . let tell . first smudge face impressed melted skin blurred imperfections . spreads easily . not settle fine lines . not cake flake dry patches . no cast tint enough even skin tone bit cover pink cheeks . dried fast almost matte . not dry powdery looking matte . almost like natural skin tiniest luster no wet oily shiny look . no scent no irritation survived several hours heat cleaning car garage sweating sun . still looked good original application came inside . even able reapply new thin layer right across top freshen . still no caking smearing smudging reapplication . holy grail already bought finally holy grail sunscreen,"['fair', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'type', '1', 'rosacea', '.', 'extreme', 'redness', 'cant', 'use', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', 'fragrance', 'iffy', '.', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'tried', 'left', 'cast', 'didnt', 'enough', 'pigment', 'blur', 'imperfections', 'caked', 'flakes', 'dry', 'patches', 'settled', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'dry', 'usually', 'still', 'needed', 'powdered', 'due', 'wet', 'face', 'look', 'never', 'reapplied', 'well', 'later', 'day.now', '.', 'let', 'tell', '.', 'first', 'smudge', 'face', 'impressed', 'melted', 'skin', 'blurred', 'imperfections', '.', 'spreads', 'easily', '.', 'not', 'settle', 'fine', 'lines', '.', 'not', 'cake', 'flake', 'dry', 'patches', '.', 'no', 'cast', 'tint', 'enough', 'even', 'skin', 'tone', 'bit', 'cover', 'pink', 'cheeks', '.', 'dried', 'fast', 'almost', 'matte', '.', 'not', 'dry', 'powdery', 'looking', 'matte', '.', 'almost', 'like', 'natural', 'skin', 'tiniest', 'luster', 'no', 'wet', 'oily', 'shiny', 'look', '.', 'no', 'scent', 'no', 'irritation', 'survived', 'several', 'hours', 'heat', 'cleaning', 'car', 'garage', 'sweating', 'sun', '.', 'still', 'looked', 'good', 'original', 'application', 'came', 'inside', '.', 'even', 'able', 'reapply', 'new', 'thin', 'layer', 'right', 'across', 'top', 'freshen', '.', 'still', 'no', 'caking', 'smearing', 'smudging', 'reapplication', '.', 'holy', 'grail', 'already', 'bought', 'finally', 'holy', 'grail', 'sunscreen']"
i really like this tinted sunscreen. my skin is olive toned mostly oily breakout prone with dry patches. this is one of the only sunscreens ive tried that doesnt irritate my face. i also like that it doesnt leave a white film like some mineral sunscreens ive tried. goes on pretty smooth and stays mostly matte throughout a normal day havent tested it on extensive outdoor activities yet. it can be a little drying which i dont mind on the oily areas but it can be tricky over the dry areas. ive been using a few dabs of cerave moisturizing cream over the dry spots before adding the sunscreen and it helps quite a bit. my only complaint is that it doesnt work very well under makeup or i still need to find one that is compatible. luckily i dont feel like i need any foundation with this but i want to wear concealer to cover up the dark bags under my eyes. ive tried sephoras make no mistake concealer but they are very much not compatible. the concealer oddly separates in a way that makes it look weird and blotchy. ive also tried tarte creaseless concealer which seems to work better but its still not wonderful. will have to keep trying to find one that works because i love this sunscreen. safe for my combobreakout prone skin,really like tinted sunscreen . skin olive toned mostly oily breakout prone dry patches . one sunscreens ive tried doesnt irritate face . also like doesnt leave white film like mineral sunscreens ive tried . goes pretty smooth stays mostly matte throughout normal day havent tested extensive outdoor activities yet . little drying dont mind oily areas tricky dry areas . ive using dabs cerave moisturizing cream dry spots adding sunscreen helps quite bit . complaint doesnt work well makeup still need find one compatible . luckily dont feel like need foundation want wear concealer cover dark bags eyes . ive tried sephoras make no mistake concealer much not compatible . concealer oddly separates way makes look weird blotchy . ive also tried tarte creaseless concealer seems work better still not wonderful . keep trying find one works love sunscreen . safe combobreakout prone skin,"['really', 'like', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', '.', 'skin', 'olive', 'toned', 'mostly', 'oily', 'breakout', 'prone', 'dry', 'patches', '.', 'one', 'sunscreens', 'ive', 'tried', 'doesnt', 'irritate', 'face', '.', 'also', 'like', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'white', 'film', 'like', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'ive', 'tried', '.', 'goes', 'pretty', 'smooth', 'stays', 'mostly', 'matte', 'throughout', 'normal', 'day', 'havent', 'tested', 'extensive', 'outdoor', 'activities', 'yet', '.', 'little', 'drying', 'dont', 'mind', 'oily', 'areas', 'tricky', 'dry', 'areas', '.', 'ive', 'using', 'dabs', 'cerave', 'moisturizing', 'cream', 'dry', 'spots', 'adding', 'sunscreen', 'helps', 'quite', 'bit', '.', 'complaint', 'doesnt', 'work', 'well', 'makeup', 'still', 'need', 'find', 'one', 'compatible', '.', 'luckily', 'dont', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'foundation', 'want', 'wear', 'concealer', 'cover', 'dark', 'bags', 'eyes', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'sephoras', 'make', 'no', 'mistake', 'concealer', 'much', 'not', 'compatible', '.', 'concealer', 'oddly', 'separates', 'way', 'makes', 'look', 'weird', 'blotchy', '.', 'ive', 'also', 'tried', 'tarte', 'creaseless', 'concealer', 'seems', 'work', 'better', 'still', 'not', 'wonderful', '.', 'keep', 'trying', 'find', 'one', 'works', 'love', 'sunscreen', '.', 'safe', 'combobreakout', 'prone', 'skin']"

like many people i dont like greasier suntan lotions. i rarely swim and dont often lay out in the sun if im putting on suntan lotion its generally because im hiking walking working or maybe fishing. this means im moving quite a bit and wearing equipment or clothing and in both cases greasier lotions tend to make their presence known. as such i prefer something which isnt so oily.first i tried skin aqua a japanese suntan lotion. i mostly used the gold variety and found that to be pretty close to perfect you can hardly tell that you are wearing it after 10m or so. the nongold version is also pretty good but slightly oilier. however both did seem not to last quite as long as other suntan lotions ive tried even if they did well enough. they are pretty expensive so maybe i was being too conservative with the quantity of lotion used.sun bum is a great deal and i heard it wasnt too greasy so i decided to try it. it is true that its much better than most lotions ive tried with the exception of some sprayon varieties which are specifically marketed as being dry. it was also completely effective stopping me from getting any sorts of burns whatsoever. it has a strong but not overpowering traditional suntan lotion smell to it. it does burn if it gets into your eyes on account of heavy sweating but i think all lotions are like that.basically while id recommend trying skin aqua first this is strong second place. not as good as skin aqua but better than most,like many people dont like greasier suntan lotions . rarely swim dont often lay sun im putting suntan lotion generally im hiking walking working maybe fishing . means im moving quite bit wearing equipment clothing cases greasier lotions tend make presence known . prefer something isnt oily.first tried skin aqua japanese suntan lotion . mostly used gold variety found pretty close perfect hardly tell wearing 10m . nongold version also pretty good slightly oilier . however seem not last quite long suntan lotions ive tried even well enough . pretty expensive maybe conservative quantity lotion used.sun bum great deal heard wasnt greasy decided try . true much better lotions ive tried exception sprayon varieties specifically marketed dry . also completely effective stopping getting sorts burns whatsoever . strong not overpowering traditional suntan lotion smell . burn gets eyes account heavy sweating think lotions like that.basically id recommend trying skin aqua first strong second place . not good skin aqua better,"['like', 'many', 'people', 'dont', 'like', 'greasier', 'suntan', 'lotions', '.', 'rarely', 'swim', 'dont', 'often', 'lay', 'sun', 'im', 'putting', 'suntan', 'lotion', 'generally', 'im', 'hiking', 'walking', 'working', 'maybe', 'fishing', '.', 'means', 'im', 'moving', 'quite', 'bit', 'wearing', 'equipment', 'clothing', 'cases', 'greasier', 'lotions', 'tend', 'make', 'presence', 'known', '.', 'prefer', 'something', 'isnt', 'oily.first', 'tried', 'skin', 'aqua', 'japanese', 'suntan', 'lotion', '.', 'mostly', 'used', 'gold', 'variety', 'found', 'pretty', 'close', 'perfect', 'hardly', 'tell', 'wearing', '10m', '.', 'nongold', 'version', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'slightly', 'oilier', '.', 'however', 'seem', 'not', 'last', 'quite', 'long', 'suntan', 'lotions', 'ive', 'tried', 'even', 'well', 'enough', '.', 'pretty', 'expensive', 'maybe', 'conservative', 'quantity', 'lotion', 'used.sun', 'bum', 'great', 'deal', 'heard', 'wasnt', 'greasy', 'decided', 'try', '.', 'true', 'much', 'better', 'lotions', 'ive', 'tried', 'exception', 'sprayon', 'varieties', 'specifically', 'marketed', 'dry', '.', 'also', 'completely', 'effective', 'stopping', 'getting', 'sorts', 'burns', 'whatsoever', '.', 'strong', 'not', 'overpowering', 'traditional', 'suntan', 'lotion', 'smell', '.', 'burn', 'gets', 'eyes', 'account', 'heavy', 'sweating', 'think', 'lotions', 'like', 'that.basically', 'id', 'recommend', 'trying', 'skin', 'aqua', 'first', 'strong', 'second', 'place', '.', 'not', 'good', 'skin', 'aqua', 'better']"
ive been using the sun bum original spf 50 sunscreen for a while now and i have mixed feelings about it. on the positive side its definitely a good sunscreen. it does its job well offering solid protection against sunburn and i havent experienced any skin issues using it. the lotion is easy to apply absorbs fairly quickly and doesnt leave a greasy residue which is a big plus for me.however there are a couple of downsides. first the price. i find it a bit on the expensive side compared to other options available. there are many other sunscreens out there that offer more quantity for a lower price. of course there are also some that cost more than sun bum but the price point is still a consideration for me. that said its worth noting that sun bum is vegan glutenfree and enriched with vitamin e. for people who need a glutenfree or vegan sunscreen or are looking for additional skin benefits from vitamin e this could justify the higher price. if youre paying extra you are getting these added benefits which you might not get from cheaper alternatives. even so i believe the price is kinda okay but it would be great if we could get a little more quantity.the second thing is the smell. this is where my feelings are really mixed. sometimes i enjoy the scent  it has a unique tropical aroma thats quite distinctive. other times im not as fond of it. i think this will really come down to personal preference some people might love it while others might find it a bit overwhelming.overall sun bum original is a reliable sunscreen that does what its supposed to do. if youre okay with the price and are curious about the scent its worth giving it a try. personally i might explore some other options next time just to see if i can find something more costeffective that i consistently enjoy. reliable protection with a few tradeoffs,ive using sun bum original spf 50 sunscreen mixed feelings . positive side definitely good sunscreen . job well offering solid protection sunburn havent experienced skin issues using . lotion easy apply absorbs fairly quickly doesnt leave greasy residue big plus me.however couple downsides . first price . find bit expensive side compared options available . many sunscreens offer quantity lower price . course also cost sun bum price point still consideration . said worth noting sun bum vegan glutenfree enriched vitamin e. people need glutenfree vegan sunscreen looking additional skin benefits vitamin e could justify higher price . youre paying extra getting added benefits might not get cheaper alternatives . even believe price kinda okay would great could get little quantity.the second thing smell . feelings really mixed . sometimes enjoy scent unique tropical aroma thats quite distinctive . times im not fond . think really come personal preference people might love others might find bit overwhelming.overall sun bum original reliable sunscreen supposed . youre okay price curious scent worth giving try . personally might explore options next time see find something costeffective consistently enjoy . reliable protection tradeoffs,"['ive', 'using', 'sun', 'bum', 'original', 'spf', '50', 'sunscreen', 'mixed', 'feelings', '.', 'positive', 'side', 'definitely', 'good', 'sunscreen', '.', 'job', 'well', 'offering', 'solid', 'protection', 'sunburn', 'havent', 'experienced', 'skin', 'issues', 'using', '.', 'lotion', 'easy', 'apply', 'absorbs', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'greasy', 'residue', 'big', 'plus', 'me.however', 'couple', 'downsides', '.', 'first', 'price', '.', 'find', 'bit', 'expensive', 'side', 'compared', 'options', 'available', '.', 'many', 'sunscreens', 'offer', 'quantity', 'lower', 'price', '.', 'course', 'also', 'cost', 'sun', 'bum', 'price', 'point', 'still', 'consideration', '.', 'said', 'worth', 'noting', 'sun', 'bum', 'vegan', 'glutenfree', 'enriched', 'vitamin', 'e.', 'people', 'need', 'glutenfree', 'vegan', 'sunscreen', 'looking', 'additional', 'skin', 'benefits', 'vitamin', 'e', 'could', 'justify', 'higher', 'price', '.', 'youre', 'paying', 'extra', 'getting', 'added', 'benefits', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'cheaper', 'alternatives', '.', 'even', 'believe', 'price', 'kinda', 'okay', 'would', 'great', 'could', 'get', 'little', 'quantity.the', 'second', 'thing', 'smell', '.', 'feelings', 'really', 'mixed', '.', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'scent', 'unique', 'tropical', 'aroma', 'thats', 'quite', 'distinctive', '.', 'times', 'im', 'not', 'fond', '.', 'think', 'really', 'come', 'personal', 'preference', 'people', 'might', 'love', 'others', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'overwhelming.overall', 'sun', 'bum', 'original', 'reliable', 'sunscreen', 'supposed', '.', 'youre', 'okay', 'price', 'curious', 'scent', 'worth', 'giving', 'try', '.', 'personally', 'might', 'explore', 'options', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'find', 'something', 'costeffective', 'consistently', 'enjoy', '.', 'reliable', 'protection', 'tradeoffs']"

protectioni like everything about this sunscreen except for its protection against the sun lol. im very fair and burn easy. covered with this sunscreen i lightly burn through it within the hour. i think it would be a better sunscreen for people with a bit more natural melanin. ill probably keep buying it for the other good qualities but ill probably start adding additional zinc powder into it for more protection.and keeping near some shade. if you are also very fair and dont want to take further steps idk if this would be a good choice for you.smellit smells wonderful. this is maybe just a personal nostalgia but to me it smells a bit like the old water intertubes from the 90s. it smells a bit like a pleasant plastic smell with hints of vanilla. anyone remember how the plasticrubber had that vanilla smell maybe to most people that might not sound like a nice smell but it does smell nice even if you dont have that nostalgia. vanilla notes a bit of a rich undertone maybe a plesant mild coconut undertone its very understated and not aggressive. it doesnt smell like  which im glad about because i find that brand overwhelming. the smell doesnt really dissapate however so if scent is an issue for you this is pretty heavily scented.applicationskin feelyou really gotta shake it a lot its a bit seperated like all the time. it looks greasy but once you apply it it goes on good. soaks in. if anyone has ever applied regular zinc powder you know how clingy zinc feels. you can slightly feel that clingy zinc powder sensation but its really mild especially if youre comparing it to full zinc power. so not oily not greasy but you can feel that the sunscreen is there.the importance of being gluten freeits gluten free. which is important for people with celiac. if youre out in the hot sun sweating and getting water on you you absolutely do get sunscreen in your mouth whether you want to believe it or not. anything near your lips or on your hands will inevitably end up in your mouth. so yes it can ve important to have sunscreen be gluten free and your chapstick and your facial sunscreen and makeups especially in the summer heat. so i feel safe about licking my lips or rubbing my face or eating food with my hands where the sunscreen is touching you food via your hands. thats a big plus for me. gluten free smells great not so good for fair skin,protectioni like everything sunscreen

this is a nice tinted mineral sunscreen. i have very sensitive skin that leans toward the dry side and rosacea so mineral sunscreens are recommended over chemical ones. it absorbs well into my skin and doesnt feel oily or drying. it pills a little bit probably because i was rubbing too much and my base moisturizer was a gel. fingers crossed with some practice the pilling will happen less.it blends really well in term of tint. i am asian with medium skin tone with olivepeach undertone and my husband is as white as the driven snow and somehow this sunscreen manages to be invisible on both of our faces. no white cast whatsoever. not completely matte but rather a healthy glow. not glossy or overly shiny at all but i dont have oily skin so i cant speak to that.this sunscreen has the best ewg score among all the drugstore sunscreen meaning it has lowest environmental and health impacts compared to other drugstore options. ive compared its score to cerave aveeno la roche pisay burts bees and cetaphil. cetaphil is the only other option that has a good score. i presume this eucerin is still nano zinc so if you want something completely reef safe you have to keep on searching. but if you want an affordable option thats available everywhere mineral no white cast non comedogenic then this sunscreen is as good as it gets. tinted mineral sunscreen that blends well to multiple skin tones and has good ewg rating,nice tinted mineral sunscreen . sensitive skin leans toward dry side rosacea mineral sunscreens recommended chemical ones . absorbs well skin doesnt feel oily drying . pills little bit probably rubbing much base moisturizer gel . fingers crossed practice pilling happen less.it blends really well term tint . asian medium skin tone olivepeach undertone husband white driven snow somehow sunscreen manages invisible faces . no white cast whatsoever . not completely matte rather healthy glow . not glossy overly shiny dont oily skin cant speak that.this sunscreen best ewg score among drugstore sunscreen meaning lowest environmental health impacts compared drugstore options . ive compared score cerave aveeno la roche pisay burts bees cetaphil . cetaphil option good score . presume eucerin still nano zinc want something completely reef safe keep searching . want affordable option thats available everywhere mineral no white cast non comedogenic sunscreen good gets . tinted mineral sunscreen blends well multiple skin tones good ewg rating,"['nice', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'leans', 'toward', 'dry', 'side', 'rosacea', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'recommended', 'chemical', 'ones', '.', 'absorbs', 'well', 'skin', 'doesnt', 'feel', 'oily', 'drying', '.', 'pills', 'little', 'bit', 'probably', 'rubbing', 'much', 'base', 'moisturizer', 'gel', '.', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'practice', 'pilling', 'happen', 'less.it', 'blends', 'really', 'well', 'term', 'tint', '.', 'asian', 'medium', 'skin', 'tone', 'olivepeach', 'undertone', 'husband', 'white', 'driven', 'snow', 'somehow', 'sunscreen', 'manages', 'invisible', 'faces', '.', 'no', 'white', 'cast', 'whatsoever', '.', 'not', 'completely', 'matte', 'rather', 'healthy', 'glow', '.', 'not', 'glossy', 'overly', 'shiny', 'dont', 'oily', 'skin', 'cant', 'speak', 'that.this', 'sunscreen', 'best', 'ewg', 'score', 'among', 'drugstore', 'sunscreen', 'meaning', 'lowest', 'environmental', 'health', 'impacts', 'compared', 'drugstore', 'options', '.', 'ive', 'compared', 'score', 'cerave', 'aveeno', 'la', 'roche', 'pisay', 'burts', 'bees', 'cetaphil', '.', 'cetaphil', 'option', 'good', 'score', '.', 'presume', 'eucerin', 'still', 'nano', 'zinc', 'want', 'something', 'completely', 'reef', 'safe', 'keep', 'searching', '.', 'want', 'affordable', 'option', 'thats', 'available', 'everywhere', 'mineral', 'no', 'white', 'cast', 'non', 'comedogenic', 'sunscreen', 'good', 'gets', '.', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'blends', 'well', 'multiple', 'skin', 'tones', 'good', 'ewg', 'rating']"

i was on the market for a tinted moisturizer that i could use daily instead of foundation but im allergic to a very common sunscreen ingredient so this was one of the few options i could safely wear.  i wasnt sure if it would meet my needs but figured at the very least id have a decent sunscreen. one tube has lasted me just over 6 months of almost daily wear and  i can report i am extremely happy with this product.the scent is vaguely warm and sweet but not stereotypically sunscreeny in any way. the texture is thick almost like a whipped lotion or cream and the product smooths on wonderfully as a result. after application it stays moist or maybe workable is a better word for a minute or two but feels like its completely absorbed once i massage it in a bit. absolutely no greasy feeling or shine the attached pictures are this product only with no powder. too often foundation leaves my skin looking dry and flaky while moisturizers make me look oily in their quest to give me a dewy glow. this product strikes the perfect balance between these two extremes for my skin.obviously i have a pretty fair complexion and the tint of this product works well for me. ive shared with with a friend with that tans more easily than i do and the coloring looking fine on her skin tone as well. better than i ever hoped,market tinted moisturizer could use daily instead foundation im allergic common sunscreen ingredient one options could safely wear . wasnt sure would meet needs figured least id decent sunscreen . one tube lasted 6 months almost daily wear report extremely happy product.the scent vaguely warm sweet not stereotypically sunscreeny way . texture thick almost like whipped lotion cream product smooths wonderfully result . application stays moist maybe workable better word minute two feels like completely absorbed massage bit . absolutely no greasy feeling shine attached pictures product no powder . often foundation leaves skin looking dry flaky moisturizers make look oily quest give dewy glow . product strikes perfect balance two extremes skin.obviously pretty fair complexion tint product works well . ive shared friend tans easily coloring looking fine skin tone well . better ever hoped,"['market', 'tinted', 'moisturizer', 'could', 'use', 'daily', 'instead', 'foundation', 'im', 'allergic', 'common', 'sunscreen', 'ingredient', 'one', 'options', 'could', 'safely', 'wear', '.', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'would', 'meet', 'needs', 'figured', 'least', 'id', 'decent', 'sunscreen', '.', 'one', 'tube', 'lasted', '6', 'months', 'almost', 'daily', 'wear', 'report', 'extremely', 'happy', 'product.the', 'scent', 'vaguely', 'warm', 'sweet', 'not', 'stereotypically', 'sunscreeny', 'way', '.', 'texture', 'thick', 'almost', 'like', 'whipped', 'lotion', 'cream', 'product', 'smooths', 'wonderfully', 'result', '.', 'application', 'stays', 'moist', 'maybe', 'workable', 'better', 'word', 'minute', 'two', 'feels', 'like', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'massage', 'bit', '.', 'absolutely', 'no', 'greasy', 'feeling', 'shine', 'attached', 'pictures', 'product', 'no', 'powder', '.', 'often', 'foundation', 'leaves', 'skin', 'looking', 'dry', 'flaky', 'moisturizers', 'make', 'look', 'oily', 'quest', 'give', 'dewy', 'glow', '.', 'product', 'strikes', 'perfect', 'balance', 'two', 'extremes', 'skin.obviously', 'pretty', 'fair', 'complexion', 'tint', 'product', 'works', 'well', '.', 'ive', 'shared', 'friend', 'tans', 'easily', 'coloring', 'looking', 'fine', 'skin', 'tone', 'well', '.', 'better', 'ever', 'hoped']"

i got this last year 2020 and im just now writing a review for it. i really like this product it does a great job. i love the tint it isnt too overwhelming or orangey it can dry out your skin so i apply with 13 drops of rose hip oil mixed in depending on how dry my skin is before application and it applies so smoothly however at the end of the day you need to use an oil cleanser or micellar water to remove completely. it work well and the sun damage on my skin the past year has decreased. my only issue is that the last bottle i ordered arrived with a cracked tube but luckily i had a container to put the product in. im looking to buy more now but will likely buy from a retailer. i also bought the tinted version of this with no indication of fairmedium or mediumtan or anything on the bottle. i have no clue what kind to purchase now but look forward to continued use of the product. love this sunscreen but definitely need to oil cleanse to remove completely,got last year 2020 im writing review . really like product great job . love tint isnt overwhelming orangey dry skin apply 13 drops rose hip oil mixed depending dry skin application applies smoothly however end day need use oil cleanser micellar water remove completely . work well sun damage skin past year decreased . issue last bottle ordered arrived cracked tube luckily container put product . im looking buy likely buy retailer . also bought tinted version no indication fairmedium mediumtan anything bottle . no clue kind purchase look forward continued use product . love sunscreen definitely need oil cleanse remove completely,"['got', 'last', 'year', '2020', 'im', 'writing', 'review', '.', 'really', 'like', 'product', 'great', 'job', '.', 'love', 'tint', 'isnt', 'overwhelming', 'orangey', 'dry', 'skin', 'apply', '13', 'drops', 'rose', 'hip', 'oil', 'mixed', 'depending', 'dry', 'skin', 'application', 'applies', 'smoothly', 'however', 'end', 'day', 'need', 'use', 'oil', 'cleanser', 'micellar', 'water', 'remove', 'completely', '.', 'work', 'well', 'sun', 'damage', 'skin', 'past', 'year', 'decreased', '.', 'issue', 'last', 'bottle', 'ordered', 'arrived', 'cracked', 'tube', 'luckily', 'container', 'put', 'product', '.', 'im', 'looking', 'buy', 'likely', 'buy', 'retailer', '.', 'also', 'bought', 'tinted', 'version', 'no', 'indication', 'fairmedium', 'mediumtan', 'anything', 'bottle', '.', 'no', 'clue', 'kind', 'purchase', 'look', 'forward', 'continued', 'use', 'product', '.', 'love', 'sunscreen', 'definitely', 'need', 'oil', 'cleanse', 'remove', 'completely']"

i have tried dozens of mineral sunscreens and this one blows every other one out of the water. i am not exaggerating when i say this is the one beauty product i cannot live without. i am a beauty and skincare junkie i wear makeup everyday. this sunscreen goes on beautifully under makeup. even my husband likes to use it so much so that i finally got him wearing sunscreen daily.  the finish is matte there is a hint of tint and there is a bit of a blurring quality. im sure plenty of people would be happy to use this as there daily bb cream instead of a light foundation. just buy it. it is perfect in every way. there are great ingredients that make it moisturizing as well. i am very very fair and the lightest tint is perfect for me. the only reason i could see someone not liking it is if you dont like that silicone feel or if you are unable to find a good shade i hesitate to recommend this to my darker friends as im not sure how dark the darkest shade is. i wear this at the beach in the office and in the dead of winter it is perfect for all seasons and climates. try it ,tried dozens mineral sunscreens one blows every one water . not exaggerating say one beauty product not live without . beauty skincare junkie wear makeup everyday . sunscreen goes beautifully makeup . even husband likes use much finally got wearing sunscreen daily . finish matte hint tint bit blurring quality . im sure plenty people would happy use daily bb cream instead light foundation . buy . perfect every way . great ingredients make moisturizing well . fair lightest tint perfect . reason could see someone not liking dont like silicone feel unable find good shade hesitate recommend darker friends im not sure dark darkest shade . wear beach office dead winter perfect seasons climates . try,"['tried', 'dozens', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'one', 'blows', 'every', 'one', 'water', '.', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'say', 'one', 'beauty', 'product', 'not', 'live', 'without', '.', 'beauty', 'skincare', 'junkie', 'wear', 'makeup', 'everyday', '.', 'sunscreen', 'goes', 'beautifully', 'makeup', '.', 'even', 'husband', 'likes', 'use', 'much', 'finally', 'got', 'wearing', 'sunscreen', 'daily', '.', 'finish', 'matte', 'hint', 'tint', 'bit', 'blurring', 'quality', '.', 'im', 'sure', 'plenty', 'people', 'would', 'happy', 'use', 'daily', 'bb', 'cream', 'instead', 'light', 'foundation', '.', 'buy', '.', 'perfect', 'every', 'way', '.', 'great', 'ingredients', 'make', 'moisturizing', 'well', '.', 'fair', 'lightest', 'tint', 'perfect', '.', 'reason', 'could', 'see', 'someone', 'not', 'liking', 'dont', 'like', 'silicone', 'feel', 'unable', 'find', 'good', 'shade', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'darker', 'friends', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'dark', 'darkest', 'shade', '.', 'wear', 'beach', 'office', 'dead', 'winter', 'perfect', 'seasons', 'climates', '.', 'try']"

update i went without this sunscreen for 2 days and freaked out. it is now my first subscribesave products this tinted sunscreen makes my fairpinkish skin look blurred and matte. it holds up to sweating no problem. i wear it alone on very light makeup days and it just slightly evens out my skin tone and redness. dries down to nothing and works over all my moisturizers and under all my makeup no greasiness never breaks me out and doesnt sting skin or eyes. this is also the only sunscreen i can wear in a thick enough layer to actually protect from the constant california sun never going without my australian gold again 3i have been searching forever for a sunscreen that is slightly mattifying or at least not an instant oil slick on my face creamy going on and easy to rub in no white cast no eyestinging less than 15 reef safe and no fake coconutbanana smell. i tried to order two different asian sunscreens that were hg products for others but my order never arrived and i couldnt wait another month for a second order so i bought this one instead  and im happy i did this sunscreen ticks all my boxes. however if you have very dry skin or a dark skin tone ymmv. it is matte on me with my combonormal skin but i still had to wear moisturizer under it or it looked dry and showed a dry patch on my skin. it might be too drying for someone with very dry skin but i still think its worth trying it out. the tint is very light so it may show a white cast on darker skin tones. my hg affordable comfortable natural tintedblurring sunscreen for daily use 3,update went without sunscreen 2 days freaked . first subscribesave products tinted sunscreen makes fairpinkish skin look blurred matte . holds sweating no problem . wear alone light makeup days slightly evens skin tone redness . dries nothing works moisturizers makeup no greasiness never breaks doesnt sting skin eyes . also sunscreen wear thick enough layer actually protect constant california sun never going without australian gold 3i searching forever sunscreen slightly mattifying least not instant oil slick face creamy going easy rub no white cast no eyestinging less 15 reef safe no fake coconutbanana smell . tried order two different asian sunscreens hg products others order never arrived couldnt wait another month second order bought one instead im happy sunscreen ticks boxes . however dry skin dark skin tone ymmv . matte combonormal skin still wear moisturizer looked dry showed dry patch skin . might drying someone dry skin still think worth trying . tint light may show white cast darker skin tones . hg affordable comfortable natural tintedblurring sunscreen daily use 3,"['update', 'went', 'without', 'sunscreen', '2', 'days', 'freaked', '.', 'first', 'subscribesave', 'products', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', 'makes', 'fairpinkish', 'skin', 'look', 'blurred', 'matte', '.', 'holds', 'sweating', 'no', 'problem', '.', 'wear', 'alone', 'light', 'makeup', 'days', 'slightly', 'evens', 'skin', 'tone', 'redness', '.', 'dries', 'nothing', 'works', 'moisturizers', 'makeup', 'no', 'greasiness', 'never', 'breaks', 'doesnt', 'sting', 'skin', 'eyes', '.', 'also', 'sunscreen', 'wear', 'thick', 'enough', 'layer', 'actually', 'protect', 'constant', 'california', 'sun', 'never', 'going', 'without', 'australian', 'gold', '3i', 'searching', 'forever', 'sunscreen', 'slightly', 'mattifying', 'least', 'not', 'instant', 'oil', 'slick', 'face', 'creamy', 'going', 'easy', 'rub', 'no', 'white', 'cast', 'no', 'eyestinging', 'less', '15', 'reef', 'safe', 'no', 'fake', 'coconutbanana', 'smell', '.', 'tried', 'order', 'two', 'different', 'asian', 'sunscreens', 'hg', 'products', 'others', 'order', 'never', 'arrived', 'couldnt', 'wait', 'another', 'month', 'second', 'order', 'bought', 'one', 'instead', 'im', 'happy', 'sunscreen', 'ticks', 'boxes', '.', 'however', 'dry', 'skin', 'dark', 'skin', 'tone', 'ymmv', '.', 'matte', 'combonormal', 'skin', 'still', 'wear', 'moisturizer', 'looked', 'dry', 'showed', 'dry', 'patch', 'skin', '.', 'might', 'drying', 'someone', 'dry', 'skin', 'still', 'think', 'worth', 'trying', '.', 'tint', 'light', 'may', 'show', 'white', 'cast', 'darker', 'skin', 'tones', '.', 'hg', 'affordable', 'comfortable', 'natural', 'tintedblurring', 'sunscreen', 'daily', 'use', '3']"

i really wanted to love this  one star for the nice texture its not pasty like a lot of zinc oxide sunscreens one star for the color which is just a slight tint and looks like a very faint tinted moisturizer on me im fairolive one star for the quality as i believe it really does work and a 4th star because i didnt have much skin sensitivity. i have super sensitive skin and zinc oxide sunscreens usually burn me. the price on this is really reasonable too. however i had a take away a star for the impossibility of washing it off. ive washed it with my facial cleansing milk bar soap oil and witch hazel and there is still a slightly sticky residue. i just cannot imagine washing this off every day.  im 37 and trying to combat signs aging and dryness. even if it does protect from sun damage there is too much tugging and drying happening getting it off so i feel like it would be a net zero. if i were just wearing in the summer at the beach i think i would stick with it but i am trying to find a daily spf to start a new routine with. for me this was a no. ,really wanted love one star nice texture not pasty like lot zinc oxide sunscreens one star color slight tint looks like faint tinted moisturizer im fairolive one star quality believe really work 4th star didnt much skin sensitivity . super sensitive skin zinc oxide sunscreens usually burn . price really reasonable . however take away star impossibility washing . ive washed facial cleansing milk bar soap oil witch hazel still slightly sticky residue . not imagine washing every day . im 37 trying combat signs aging dryness . even protect sun damage much tugging drying happening getting feel like would net zero . wearing summer beach think would stick trying find daily spf start new routine . no .,"['really', 'wanted', 'love', 'one', 'star', 'nice', 'texture', 'not', 'pasty', 'like', 'lot', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'sunscreens', 'one', 'star', 'color', 'slight', 'tint', 'looks', 'like', 'faint', 'tinted', 'moisturizer', 'im', 'fairolive', 'one', 'star', 'quality', 'believe', 'really', 'work', '4th', 'star', 'didnt', 'much', 'skin', 'sensitivity', '.', 'super', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'sunscreens', 'usually', 'burn', '.', 'price', 'really', 'reasonable', '.', 'however', 'take', 'away', 'star', 'impossibility', 'washing', '.', 'ive', 'washed', 'facial', 'cleansing', 'milk', 'bar', 'soap', 'oil', 'witch', 'hazel', 'still', 'slightly', 'sticky', 'residue', '.', 'not', 'imagine', 'washing', 'every', 'day', '.', 'im', '37', 'trying', 'combat', 'signs', 'aging', 'dryness', '.', 'even', 'protect', 'sun', 'damage', 'much', 'tugging', 'drying', 'happening', 'getting', 'feel', 'like', 'would', 'net', 'zero', '.', 'wearing', 'summer', 'beach', 'think', 'would', 'stick', 'trying', 'find', 'daily', 'spf', 'start', 'new', 'routine', '.', 'no', '.']"
update ive reduced my review by a star because i got sunburnt again using this product. my only two sunburns in the last few years as someone who spends every day outside in california. i know it was the sunscreen because i literally only burnt where i applied it. the rest of my face was red ending where i stopped applying this sunscreen a ring around my eyes where i put my eye cream  was fine. i had better protection from a nonspf eye cream than this. this product increased my sunburns  ive literally never had a sunscreen do that. i hope my skin will be okay.original reviewwhy i tried it i began using this because even tho i never burn but instead typically tan even without sunscreen i still want protection for my face. the laroch posay milk sunscreen with 100 spf i was using left my face feeling oily so i wanted to switch to this mineral based product. i used this for 1 whole week that was mostly gloomy and my first thoughts were that i love it. the tint has pink undertones which i wasnt crazy about on my beige complexion but i thought if i liked it enough ill buy again on their site and get a tanner tint it shows on amazon they have multiple tints available even though i only see this one i wish that was easier to find and buy for my dark skinned friends.the feel it has a matte finish which i liked for going on walks and hikes. i never felt sticky even when i was sweating. this feels dry and like my skin is actually my skin. because it sticks on so well i actually had a hard time taking it off at the end of the day with my facial cleanser so i knew and trusted the product stayed on my skin it repels water very well so i thought this stuff would be perfect for vacations it will never come off in the water at the beach or pool unfortunately it didnt protect well when i needed it to.sun protection for on the gloomy days i loved it and it stays on well but when it came time to shine literally on the first sunny day i got a sunburn on my face i never burn. ever. and was only burnt on my face where i applied this product and no where else on my body. because of this i cant give it good review since at the end of the day i need it to protect me from the sun and this had the opposite effectmy skin type i have dry skin that sometimes has reactions to sunscreens. i had no reaction to this one other than some light acne. i cant be sure if the acne was due to hormones or the product but i wanted to mention it since i did notice the difference.all this being said i did like the feel of this product and that its safe for reefs and mineral based because of that i will continue to try it out since i have so much product left. if i notice a difference and that im not getting burnt and that it was perhaps a oneoff situation i will of course change my review but if this is still up as is i stand by what i said in that this product actually increased my chances of sunburns. i got sunburns only where i used this,update ive reduced review star got sunburnt using product . two sunburns last years someone spends every day outside california . know sunscreen literally burnt applied . rest face red ending stopped applying sunscreen ring around eyes put eye cream fine . better protection nonspf eye cream . product increased sunburns ive literally never sunscreen . hope skin okay.original reviewwhy tried began using even tho never burn instead

i have hyperpigmentation on my forehead where i need to wear a high spf sunscreen daily. add to that i have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and allergic to fragrances. its been a challenge trying to find a good sunscreen that wouldnt cause breakouts effective and wouldnt leave me looking like a ghostwhen i first squeezed it out of the tube it came out a bit thick and thought this is going to be another one that will be hard to work into my skin. so glad i was wrong. it spreads so easily without any tugging or constant rubbing in. it actually has more of a primer feel than a thick sunscreen. i apply this on my face and top it off with bare mineral powder  it leaves my face with a nice matte finish that really lasts all day for me. no oily face no shine. the one thing i will say is that when you first see the color it looks like it will be dark on your skin. but it actually spreads on lighter on your face. i have olive skin tone so my face had a bit of a lighter tint to it so i do wish they offered a darker tint option. it protects my face pretty well but i do wear a hat to keep my forehead covered if im going to be out in the sun a long time to prevent any darkening of the hyperpigmentation spots.one thing to note since it does leave a matte finish this may not be the best for drier or mature skin. im in my late 40s but with light oily skin that works well with this sunscreen.this one is a keeper for me and really glad i found a product that didnt affect my sensitive allergic and acne prone skin ,hyperpigmentation forehead need wear high spf sunscreen daily . add sensitive skin prone breakouts allergic fragrances . challenge trying find good sunscreen wouldnt cause breakouts effective wouldnt leave looking like ghostwhen first squeezed tube came bit thick thought going another one hard work skin . glad wrong . spreads easily without tugging constant rubbing . actually primer feel thick sunscreen . apply face top bare mineral powder leaves face nice matte finish really lasts day . no oily face no shine . one thing say first see color looks like dark skin . actually spreads lighter face . olive skin tone face bit lighter tint wish offered darker tint option . protects face pretty well wear hat keep forehead covered im going sun long time prevent darkening hyperpigmentation spots.one thing note since leave matte finish may not best drier mature skin . im late 40s light oily skin works well sunscreen.this one keeper really glad found product didnt affect sensitive allergic acne prone skin,"['hyperpigmentation', 'forehead', 'need', 'wear', 'high', 'spf', 'sunscreen', 'daily', '.', 'add', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'prone', 'breakouts', 'allergic', 'fragrances', '.', 'challenge', 'trying', 'find', 'good', 'sunscreen', 'wouldnt', 'cause', 'breakouts', 'effective', 'wouldnt', 'leave', 'looking', 'like', 'ghostwhen', 'first', 'squeezed', 'tube', 'came', 'bit', 'thick', 'thought', 'going', 'another', 'one', 'hard', 'work', 'skin', '.', 'glad', 'wrong', '.', 'spreads', 'easily', 'without', 'tugging', 'constant', 'rubbing', '.', 'actually', 'primer', 'feel', 'thick', 'sunscreen', '.', 'apply', 'face', 'top', 'bare', 'mineral', 'powder', 'leaves', 'face', 'nice', 'matte', 'finish', 'really', 'lasts', 'day', '.', 'no', 'oily', 'face', 'no', 'shine', '.', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'first', 'see', 'color', 'looks', 'like', 'dark', 'skin', '.', 'actually', 'spreads', 'lighter', 'face', '.', 'olive', 'skin', 'tone', 'face', 'bit', 'lighter', 'tint', 'wish', 'offered', 'darker', 'tint', 'option', '.', 'protects', 'face', 'pretty', 'well', 'wear', 'hat', 'keep', 'forehead', 'covered', 'im', 'going', 'sun', 'long', 'time', 'prevent', 'darkening', 'hyperpigmentation', 'spots.one', 'thing', 'note', 'since', 'leave', 'matte', 'finish', 'may', 'not', 'best', 'drier', 'mature', 'skin', '.', 'im', 'late', '40s', 'light', 'oily', 'skin', 'works', 'well', 'sunscreen.this', 'one', 'keeper', 'really', 'glad', 'found', 'product', 'didnt', 'affect', 'sensitive', 'allergic', 'acne', 'prone', 'skin']"

i bought this after reading about it in an article on sunscreens. i have rosacea seborrheic dermatitis and generally just very sensitive skin so i cant use 99.9 of facial products because they cause a reaction. i cant use any chemical sunscreens this is mineral which is a physical sunscreen and avoid all the usual junk like fragrance petroleum sls etc. i get tired of being shamed for not wearing sunscreen when i literally cant and then recently i noticed dark age spots developing which was depressing. i just avoid the sun as much as possible as my only option. so i decided to take a chance on this. im really glad i did im happy with the product and performance.i tried a couple methods of application and found i prefer using a silicone applicator the best. it doesnt get all over my hands and the product goes on smooth and evenly very easy and quick. the silicone applicator reduces wasted product also it lets me get a thin and even application. i accidentally tested how well it worked  i applied it to my face before a hot summer day of running errands but didnt think to put sunscreen on the rest of my body. later that night i realized the back of my neck and arms were pink from the sun but my face was totally fine. so obviously australian gold kept my face protected from the sun while the rest of me got a little too much uv oops. i also used it while tubing on a river all day with a large straw hat too and had no problems. im very pale and i got the tinted version it blends in nicely with the silicone applicator and i feel confident wearing it for both the look and the protection. good for rosacea use silicone applicator for best result,bought reading article sunscreens . rosacea seborrheic dermatitis generally sensitive skin cant use 99.9 facial products cause reaction . cant use chemical sunscreens mineral physical sunscreen avoid usual junk like fragrance petroleum sls etc . get tired shamed not wearing sunscreen literally cant recently noticed dark age spots developing depressing . avoid sun much possible option . decided take chance . im really glad im happy product performance.i tried couple methods application found prefer using silicone applicator best . doesnt get hands product goes smooth evenly easy quick . silicone applicator reduces wasted product also lets get thin even application . accidentally tested well worked applied face hot summer day running errands didnt think put sunscreen rest body . later night realized back neck arms pink sun face totally fine . obviously australian gold kept face protected sun rest got little much uv oops . also used tubing river day large straw hat no problems . im pale got tinted version blends nicely silicone applicator feel confident wearing look protection . good rosacea use silicone applicator best result,"['bought', 'reading', 'article', 'sunscreens', '.', 'rosacea', 'seborrheic', 'dermatitis', 'generally', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'cant', 'use', '99.9', 'facial', 'products', 'cause', 'reaction', '.', 'cant', 'use', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', 'mineral', 'physical', 'sunscreen', 'avoid', 'usual', 'junk', 'like', 'fragrance', 'petroleum', 'sls', 'etc', '.', 'get', 'tired', 'shamed', 'not', 'wearing', 'sunscreen', 'literally', 'cant', 'recently', 'noticed', 'dark', 'age', 'spots', 'developing', 'depressing', '.', 'avoid', 'sun', 'much', 'possible', 'option', '.', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', '.', 'im', 'really', 'glad', 'im', 'happy', 'product', 'performance.i', 'tried', 'couple', 'methods', 'application', 'found', 'prefer', 'using', 'silicone', 'applicator', 'best', '.', 'doesnt', 'get', 'hands', 'product', 'goes', 'smooth', 'evenly', 'easy', 'quick', '.', 'silicone', 'applicator', 'reduces', 'wasted', 'product', 'also', 'lets', 'get', 'thin', 'even', 'application', '.', 'accidentally', 'tested', 'well', 'worked', 'applied', 'face', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'running', 'errands', 'didnt', 'think', 'put', 'sunscreen', 'rest', 'body', '.', 'later', 'night', 'realized', 'back', 'neck', 'arms', 'pink', 'sun', 'face', 'totally', 'fine', '.', 'obviously', 'australian', 'gold', 'kept', 'face', 'protected', 'sun', 'rest', 'got', 'little', 'much', 'uv', 'oops', '.', 'also', 'used', 'tubing', 'river', 'day', 'large', 'straw', 'hat', 'no', 'problems', '.', 'im', 'pale', 'got', 'tinted', 'version', 'blends', 'nicely', 'silicone', 'applicator', 'feel', 'confident', 'wearing', 'look', 'protection', '.', 'good', 'rosacea', 'use', 'silicone', 'applicator', 'best', 'result']"

im hesitant when i buy any type of face lotion especially with sunscreen because i dont want the greasy feeling or for it to break my skin out.  i havent been using this lotion too long but so far im very happy with it.  its super light weight and easy to put on.  not much is needed to cover your whole face and i wouldnt over do it with the application.  i love that its a tinted lotion so it doesnt completely white out your face like sunscreen lotion can do.  its great to wear under makeup its smooth and not at all greasy so it almost acts as a primer for your face makeup i love that aspect of it.  its so important for us to wear sunscreen on our faces necks and ears so this is the perfect product for anyone not wanting to wear straight sunscreen on a daily basis.i do have pretty sensitive skin and live in a dry climate so i really do need very gentle yet effective products for my face.  there was one incident when my forehead got a tiny bit irritated after putting this on.  i cant blame this product for that though because it could have been another product or my skin might have just been extra dry that day and was upset when i did put a moisturizer on it.  so i would just warn people with really sensitive or dry skin to go easy with it at first and use a very little bit to see how your skin handles it i would still recommend buying it though. ,im hesitant buy type face lotion especially sunscreen dont want greasy feeling break skin . havent using lotion long far im happy . super light weight easy put . not much needed cover whole face wouldnt application . love tinted lotion doesnt completely white face like sunscreen lotion . great wear makeup smooth not greasy almost acts primer face makeup love aspect . important us wear sunscreen faces necks ears perfect product anyone not wanting wear straight sunscreen daily basis.i pretty sensitive skin live dry climate really need gentle yet effective products face . one incident forehead got tiny bit irritated putting . cant blame product though could another product skin might extra dry day upset put moisturizer . would warn people really sensitive dry skin go easy first use little bit see skin handles would still recommend buying though .,"['im', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'type', 'face', 'lotion', 'especially', 'sunscreen', 'dont', 'want', 'greasy', 'feeling', 'break', 'skin', '.', 'havent', 'using', 'lotion', 'long', 'far', 'im', 'happy', '.', 'super', 'light', 'weight', 'easy', 'put', '.', 'not', 'much', 'needed', 'cover', 'whole', 'face', 'wouldnt', 'application', '.', 'love', 'tinted', 'lotion', 'doesnt', 'completely', 'white', 'face', 'like', 'sunscreen', 'lotion', '.', 'great', 'wear', 'makeup', 'smooth', 'not', 'greasy', 'almost', 'acts', 'primer', 'face', 'makeup', 'love', 'aspect', '.', 'important', 'us', 'wear', 'sunscreen', 'faces', 'necks', 'ears', 'perfect', 'product', 'anyone', 'not', 'wanting', 'wear', 'straight', 'sunscreen', 'daily', 'basis.i', 'pretty', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'live', 'dry', 'climate', 'really', 'need', 'gentle', 'yet', 'effective', 'products', 'face', '.', 'one', 'incident', 'forehead', 'got', 'tiny', 'bit', 'irritated', 'putting', '.', 'cant', 'blame', 'product', 'though', 'could', 'another', 'product', 'skin', 'might', 'extra', 'dry', 'day', 'upset', 'put', 'moisturizer', '.', 'would', 'warn', 'people', 'really', 'sensitive', 'dry', 'skin', 'go', 'easy', 'first', 'use', 'little', 'bit', 'see', 'skin', 'handles', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'buying', 'though', '.']"

i bought this lotion in an effort to rid myself of a stubborn and ugly rash around my mouth and nose  perioral dermatitis.  some comment i read from some blog suggested that zinc might help.  i chose this lotion for the simple safe ingredients.  i put it on in the evenings after washing my face with a dead sea soap adovia.  i put the lotion on fairly thick  its quite white and thick  and let the zinc do its thing while i slept.  it worked  its been keeping my rash down for a year now.  sometimes the rash flares up again from sunshine chlorine and a little of this lotion tames it right down.  i love it  i use it at night a few times a week and sometimes i use it in the morning as my sunscreen.  in that case i use less lotion and i just give it a few minutes to soak in  it does come on white but soaks in just fine.  i still wear a hat  perioral dermatitis flares easily in sunshine it seems.  i hope this helps anyone else dealing with this frustrating rash a huge help in conquering a rash  perioral dermatitis,bought lotion effort rid stubborn ugly rash around mouth nose perioral dermatitis . comment read blog suggested zinc might help . chose lotion simple safe ingredients . put evenings washing face dead sea soap adovia . put lotion fairly thick quite white thick let zinc thing slept . worked keeping rash year . sometimes rash flares sunshine chlorine little lotion tames right . love use night times week sometimes use morning sunscreen . case use less lotion give minutes soak come white soaks fine . still wear hat perioral dermatitis flares easily sunshine seems . hope helps anyone else dealing frustrating rash huge help conquering rash perioral dermatitis,"['bought', 'lotion', 'effort', 'rid', 'stubborn', 'ugly', 'rash', 'around', 'mouth', 'nose', 'perioral', 'dermatitis', '.', 'comment', 'read', 'blog', 'suggested', 'zinc', 'might', 'help', '.', 'chose', 'lotion', 'simple', 'safe', 'ingredients', '.', 'put', 'evenings', 'washing', 'face', 'dead', 'sea', 'soap', 'adovia', '.', 'put', 'lotion', 'fairly', 'thick', 'quite', 'white', 'thick', 'let', 'zinc', 'thing', 'slept', '.', 'worked', 'keeping', 'rash', 'year', '.', 'sometimes', 'rash', 'flares', 'sunshine', 'chlorine', 'little', 'lotion', 'tames', 'right', '.', 'love', 'use', 'night', 'times', 'week', 'sometimes', 'use', 'morning', 'sunscreen', '.', 'case', 'use', 'less', 'lotion', 'give', 'minutes', 'soak', 'come', 'white', 'soaks', 'fine', '.', 'still', 'wear', 'hat', 'perioral', 'dermatitis', 'flares', 'easily', 'sunshine', 'seems', '.', 'hope', 'helps', 'anyone', 'else', 'dealing', 'frustrating', 'rash', 'huge', 'help', 'conquering', 'rash', 'perioral', 'dermatitis']"
this really is one of the best natural suncreens ive used.  as some users have pointed out it doesnt slide on like regular sunscreen that you can glob on and rub all over your body from one place.  because it is a natural product nonchemical nonsynthetic the application is a bit different and you need to put a bit on the skin rub it into the surrounding area then put a bit on the skin in another place and rub into the surrounding area etc.  took me and my wifekids a bit of time to figure that out but once we did the product did fully disappear from the skin.  also because the consistency is thicker if you put too much on in one place you will definitely have more trouble rubbing it in.  yes a bit different than the standard chemical based sunscreens that absorb into the skin with all the potential health issues and not always the easiest to apply on a squirming child but given the nonchemical top ewg ranking nature of the product it really is a good tradeoff in my bookmy wife and i had really grown to love this brand and the other products  this sunscreen is just another product from babo that is really excellent. best natural sunscreen  a bit of a different applicaltion vs. regular sunscreens though,really one best natural suncreens ive used . users pointed doesnt slide like regular sunscreen glob rub body one place . natural product nonchemical nonsynthetic application bit different need put bit skin rub surrounding area put bit skin another place rub surrounding area etc . took wifekids bit time figure product fully disappear skin . also consistency thicker put much one place definitely trouble rubbing . yes bit different standard chemical based sunscreens absorb skin potential health issues not always easiest apply squirming child given nonchemical top ewg ranking nature product really good tradeoff bookmy wife really grown love brand products sunscreen another product babo really excellent . best natural sunscreen bit different applicaltion vs. regular sunscreens though,"['really', 'one', 'best', 'natural', 'suncreens', 'ive', 'used', '.', 'users', 'pointed', 'doesnt', 'slide', 'like', 'regular', 'sunscreen', 'glob', 'rub', 'body', 'one', 'place', '.', 'natural', 'product', 'nonchemical', 'nonsynthetic', 'application', 'bit', 'different', 'need', 'put', 'bit', 'skin', 'rub', 'surrounding', 'area', 'put', 'bit', 'skin', 'another', 'place', 'rub', 'surrounding', 'area', 'etc', '.', 'took', 'wifekids', 'bit', 'time', 'figure', 'product', 'fully', 'disappear', 'skin', '.', 'also', 'consistency', 'thicker', 'put', 'much', 'one', 'place', 'definitely', 'trouble', 'rubbing', '.', 'yes', 'bit', 'different', 'standard', 'chemical', 'based', 'sunscreens', 'absorb', 'skin', 'potential', 'health', 'issues', 'not', 'always', 'easiest', 'apply', 'squirming', 'child', 'given', 'nonchemical', 'top', 'ewg', 'ranking', 'nature', 'product', 'really', 'good', 'tradeoff', 'bookmy', 'wife', 'really', 'grown', 'love', 'brand', 'products', 'sunscreen', 'another', 'product', 'babo', 'really', 'excellent', '.', 'best', 'natural', 'sunscreen', 'bit', 'different', 'applicaltion', 'vs.', 'regular', 'sunscreens', 'though']"

this sunscreen applies pretty smoothly and doesnt clump up. it seems to be pretty water resistant based on my experience with using it while exercising. removal is easy with an oil cleanser followed by my foaming salicylic acid cleanser. im sure any foaming cleanser would be sufficient but i just want to make sure all of it is removed at the end of the day.there is a noticeable white cast but depending on how much you apply and if its the second or later application its not too awful. ive been working from home so its not really a concern. plus ive gotten used to it.what i really like is that it doesnt break me out. ive used mineral sunscreens from big brands that youd think would make agreeable products and they broke my out. i dont normally rely on ewg scoring but i definitely agree with the score for this sunscreen.i highly recommend using a good moisturizer under this sunscreen. this is only a sunscreen. it doesnt moisturize. i use vanicream facial moisturizer with it and theres no pilling. even when applied minutes later. great for acne and folliculitis prone skin,sunscreen applies pretty smoothly doesnt clump . seems pretty water resistant based experience using exercising . removal easy oil cleanser followed foaming salicylic acid cleanser . im sure foaming cleanser would sufficient want make sure removed end day.there noticeable white cast depending much apply second later application not awful . ive working home not really concern . plus ive gotten used it.what really like doesnt break . ive used mineral sunscreens big brands youd think would make agreeable products broke . dont normally rely ewg scoring definitely agree score sunscreen.i highly recommend using good moisturizer sunscreen . sunscreen . doesnt moisturize . use vanicream facial moisturizer theres no pilling . even applied minutes later . great acne folliculitis prone skin,"['sunscreen', 'applies', 'pretty', 'smoothly', 'doesnt', 'clump', '.', 'seems', 'pretty', 'water', 'resistant', 'based', 'experience', 'using', 'exercising', '.', 'removal', 'easy', 'oil', 'cleanser', 'followed', 'foaming', 'salicylic', 'acid', 'cleanser', '.', 'im', 'sure', 'foaming', 'cleanser', 'would', 'sufficient', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'removed', 'end', 'day.there', 'noticeable', 'white', 'cast', 'depending', 'much', 'apply', 'second', 'later', 'application', 'not', 'awful', '.', 'ive', 'working', 'home', 'not', 'really', 'concern', '.', 'plus', 'ive', 'gotten', 'used', 'it.what', 'really', 'like', 'doesnt', 'break', '.', 'ive', 'used', 'mineral', 'sunscreens', 'big', 'brands', 'youd', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'agreeable', 'products', 'broke', '.', 'dont', 'normally', 'rely', 'ewg', 'scoring', 'definitely', 'agree', 'score', 'sunscreen.i', 'highly', 'recommend', 'using', 'good', 'moisturizer', 'sunscreen', '.', 'sunscreen', '.', 'doesnt', 'moisturize', '.', 'use', 'vanicream', 'facial', 'moisturizer', 'theres', 'no', 'pilling', '.', 'even', 'applied', 'minutes', 'later', '.', 'great', 'acne', 'folliculitis', 'prone', 'skin']"

so my original review is below and i will leave that intact  4 stars. my new review is as followsthe reformulation of this product is awful awful awful can i write that more yes i will point out that babo added more cheaper filler ingredients and upped the price over the past few months hmm. besides changing the ingredients they now tout their product as glutenfree this is sunscreen youre not eating it kids i digress. anyway they also removed the extra from the sensitive skin note on the front of the tube and i can see why after today.after running out of my last tube i opened my new tube i ordered 2 through subscribe and save i didnt realize the ingredients list had changed its too late to return them now. the texture is certainly much easier to apply than the old formulation but since i cut the product with aloe another step but easypeasy it was something i could live with. the new texture was watery and runny you have to shake the tube quite a bit first before you use it something i hated about other natural sunscreens like avalon organics. at first i thought i had a bad batch. it smelled different too. once sufficiently shaken repeat often probably before youre done applying it to your face the texture isnt too bad but its definitely slipperier than the old formula and not necessarily in a good way. i guess if spreadability was a dealbreaker for you as it seems to have been for most users it might be more appealing now dont expect a miracle with zinc oxide not being white though.as soon as i applied the sunscreen my face stung and burned for 10 minutes my skin isnt dry fyi so that wasnt the cause. i had no idea why this was happening i wondered if i had a bad batch and then i compared the tubes. ingredients change. apparently the change in the formula is why they took that extra sensitive off the label. so if you do have more particular skin its not for you. whatever they did to it caused me to break out too. i also found it flakedpeeled off more easily than the old recipe even though it does blend more easily.so all in all. im done with babo. they used to have a decent product but since its not good any more im going to try to find a new sunscreen that doesnt irritate my delicate facial skin. i loved that the old version didnt irritate my skin or trigger breakouts and i could live with zinc oxide pallid clown makeup face i would take that over pilling burning and acne. i want a functional nonirritating nonnanoparticle zinc oxide sunscreen and babo no longer fits the bill which is a shame since they had a great zinc content.the rundownstinging and acne its not for extra sensitive skin anymorecheaper ingredients higher priceproduct is messier has consistency issues very runny without constant shakingproduct doesnt actually stay on your skin anymore but there are fewer issues with giant white smears.high zinc content still a plusold reveiwi like this product and i will continue to buy it. it might not be for everyone though.prosshort simple relatively safe ingredients good for sensitive skin pregnant women and people who are concerned about lots of additives.good ewg ratingno fragranceif youre the color of elmers glue or chalk it will blend right in with your skin tone without a problemzinc is pretty much the best sunscreen ingredient.consit is really thickgoes on really really white so you will need to blend it. i recommend doing a little bit at a time or mixing it with aloe vera gel to improve spreadability so you can blend it in. or you could mix it in with a little of your regular moisturizer just make sure you get good coverage and dont dilute the product too much. remember why youre wearing sunscreenfor people who tan or people with nonpaperwhite skin it will be really visible on your skin tone.if you get a little oily or sweaty it will rub off. make sure to reapply if you havent done so for several hours this goes for all sunscreens anyway old formulation was much better 4 stars this product

i like this sunscreen overall.  there is virtually no whitecast by the time you get it rubbed in.  for that reason alone this is a great option for the price.  for me it feels a little thick going on and not in a dewymoisturizing type of way.  it actually dries a little tacky in my opinion.  i have dry and sensitive skin so my skin can usually handle extra moisture but i dont like the tackiness that doesnt sink in or fade all day.  for that reason i think i will look for another sunscreen that will be better for everday wear probably means more  and save this one for wearing out on the boat or for lake days when i dont mind something a little more heavy duty.update 42821 ive been using this sunscreen daily now for 6 weeks as the last step in my skincare routine.  i ended up not looking for a different product in an effort to save money and not be wasteful.  this product has grown on me  my sister recommended that i try a translucentsetting powder over the sunscreen and that significantly helped with the tackiness.  for best results i personally recommend these steps for applying1 using clean hands rub a nickelsized amount of sunscreen between your hands.  really rub it around.2 gently patrub the sunscreen all over your face.3 repeat steps 1 and 2 with another nickelsized amount if desired i think derms are typically recommending using a quarter sized amount for best protection.4 wait at least 10 minutes i prefer 30 before applying powder to let the sunscreen soak in and dry down.  powdered foundation probably would work just as well as translucent powder though ive only tried the latter.when i follow these steps i find the tackiness to be much less of an issue and the white cast is virtually nonexistent at least for my fair skin.i still give this sunscreen 4 stars because although im liking it i probably will not repurchase after ive used it up. she good but she thicc not my favorite for everyday wear,like sunscreen overall . virtually no whitecast time

i had been wanting to try this sunscreen for quite a while. i had seen a few youtubers recommend it and had also read some good reviews. the only reason i hadnt purchased before now is that i had wanted to use up some other sunscreens before i bought a new one. first lets list the bad thing about this the bad smell when you first put it on. not sure if i got a bad tube but it has that bad smell that i associate with fake tanning products that i have used in the past. i always hated that smell and this is no exception. the good thing is that i do not notice it after about 10 minutes. not sure if that is me just getting used to it or if it just disappears i am guessing the later.the good things about it is that it is tinted. i have skin that is fairwarm. a lot of my base foundation colors say light beige or buff beige.this color is not too ashy and doesnt make me look like a cast member of the living dead. im not sure how it would look on darker skin tones but for me it works great.the next thing is that it goes on like a dream really smooth and does not require a lot of rubbing or pulling on the skin. it blends really well. another bonus is that it has a nice finish. it has the look of a light bb or cc cream not total coverage like a base. it doesnt cover up my skin flaws but does blur them slightly but its a sunscreen so i wasnt expecting it to do that. it is more matte and not dewy or greasy which i like.lastly it does not pill or cause any other problems under makeup. overall i like it i just wish they would do something about that smell good product but initial smell isnt good,wanting try sunscreen quite . seen youtubers recommend also read good reviews . reason hadnt purchased wanted use sunscreens bought new one . first lets list bad thing bad smell first put . not sure got bad tube bad smell associate fake tanning products used past . always hated smell no exception . good thing not notice 10 minutes . not sure getting used disappears guessing later.the good things tinted . skin fairwarm . lot base foundation colors say light beige buff beige.this color not ashy doesnt make look like cast member living dead . im not sure would look darker skin tones works great.the next thing goes like dream really smooth not require lot rubbing pulling skin . blends really well . another bonus nice finish . look light bb cc cream not total coverage like base . doesnt cover skin flaws blur slightly sunscreen wasnt expecting . matte not dewy greasy like.lastly not pill cause problems makeup . overall like wish would something smell good product initial smell isnt good,"['wanting', 'try', 'sunscreen', 'quite', '.', 'seen', 'youtubers', 'recommend', 'also', 'read', 'good', 'reviews', '.', 'reason', 'hadnt', 'purchased', 'wanted', 'use', 'sunscreens', 'bought', 'new', 'one', '.', 'first', 'lets', 'list', 'bad', 'thing', 'bad', 'smell', 'first', 'put', '.', 'not', 'sure', 'got', 'bad', 'tube', 'bad', 'smell', 'associate', 'fake', 'tanning', 'products', 'used', 'past', '.', 'always', 'hated', 'smell', 'no', 'exception', '.', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'notice', '10', 'minutes', '.', 'not', 'sure', 'getting', 'used', 'disappears', 'guessing', 'later.the', 'good', 'things', 'tinted', '.', 'skin', 'fairwarm', '.', 'lot', 'base', 'foundation', 'colors', 'say', 'light', 'beige', 'buff', 'beige.this', 'color', 'not', 'ashy', 'doesnt', 'make', 'look', 'like', 'cast', 'member', 'living', 'dead', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'look', 'darker', 'skin', 'tones', 'works', 'great.the', 'next', 'thing', 'goes', 'like', 'dream', 'really', 'smooth', 'not', 'require', 'lot', 'rubbing', 'pulling', 'skin', '.', 'blends', 'really', 'well', '.', 'another', 'bonus', 'nice', 'finish', '.', 'look', 'light', 'bb', 'cc', 'cream', 'not', 'total', 'coverage', 'like', 'base', '.', 'doesnt', 'cover', 'skin', 'flaws', 'blur', 'slightly', 'sunscreen', 'wasnt', 'expecting', '.', 'matte', 'not', 'dewy', 'greasy', 'like.lastly', 'not', 'pill', 'cause', 'problems', 'makeup', '.', 'overall', 'like', 'wish', 'would', 'something', 'smell', 'good', 'product', 'initial', 'smell', 'isnt', 'good']"

im reviewing for the spf 50 tinted facial sunscreen the one with the green leaves. i feel like the untinted body sunscreens are diluting the overall review rating for this product listing.amazon  please separate these productsthis tinted facial sunscreen is the first ever sunscreen that im actually happy to put on in the morning and dont need to force myself to do it just because i know i must.ive previously tried sunscreens from neutrogena la roche posay shiseido some korean brands and the only one i was able to somewhat stick with was the la roche posay tinted mineral sunscreen. that product has a rather dark tint feels slightly greasy and pills near my hairline when used under certain makeup but i was able to live with it for several years for lack of a better option.this australian gold tinted sunscreen applies exceptionally well and does not cause any pilling on top of all my skincare products and under my foundation i currently use the ordinary full coverage foundation.the tint isnt visible when you apply it on your skin and does not provide any coverage so dont worry that the tint is too light or too dark for your skin tone. the product is definitely not meant to be a tinted moisturizer or bbcc cream. the only reason for the tint is that it masks the white cast that mineral sunscreen normally gives off. theres a very faint scent to the product which shouldnt bother anyone.note this sunscreen contains a fair amount of silicone which makes it smooth slightly emollient and yet mattelooking. if you dont like silicone then this is probably not for you.lastly i will say that i bought this sunscreen at the same time as the new revlon full coverage founation the one thats supposed to replace the old whipped foundation but in my opinion is completely different. when i used the two together it was an absolute nightmare. the foundation applies patchy af and pills like theres no tomorrow. i gathered this is because that foundation also contains a lot of silicone and silicone products dont layer well together sunscreen perfection in a bottle,im reviewing spf 50 tinted facial sunscreen one green leaves . feel like untinted body

ive been trying to stick with a mineral sunscreen because many of the chemical sunscreens have active ingredients that are endocrine disruptors or harbor other risks. this includes many of the asian sunscreens like biores watery essence etc. people seem to rave about. i bought this tinted mineral sunscreen from australian gold not actually an australian company fyi they are based in indianapolis in and have been satisfied with it with some reservations.pros it has among the most benign ingredient list of any sunscreen ive found its free of problematic chemical sunscreens like oxybenzone or octinoxate free of paba is reef safe etc. in terms of wearability i like that it feels like i have nothing on my skin while im wearing it that it is a completely physical sunscreen and it seems to have protected my face while outdoors.cons the tint may not work for your skin. i have darker olive skin with a yellow undertone. the tint on this is more pale pink and when i first put it on it can leave a pale cast. that said it seems to blend in okay after a few minutes if i dont use too much. also this sunscreen contains silica which will tend to dry out your skin and will create an almost masklike layer on the surface of your skin. this is probably what helps the zinc and titanium the active ingredients in this form a protective layer but it renders the sunscreen not water soluble. that means you cant really wash it off with just water or a water based cleanser. i havent found this to be too bothersome but if youre bothered by buildup you may want to get an oilbased cleansercleansing oil to get this stuff completely off.overall i am satisfied with this sunscreen and will probably buy it again when it runs out. good mineral sunscreen but with some quirks.,ive trying stick mineral sunscreen many chemical sunscreens active ingredients endocrine disruptors harbor risks . includes many asian sunscreens like biores watery essence etc . people seem rave . bought tinted mineral sunscreen australian gold not actually australian company fyi based indianapolis satisfied reservations.pros among benign ingredient list sunscreen ive found free problematic chemical sunscreens like oxybenzone octinoxate free paba reef safe etc . terms wearability like feels like nothing skin im wearing completely physical sunscreen seems protected face outdoors.cons tint may not work skin . darker olive skin yellow undertone . tint pale pink first put leave pale cast . said seems blend okay minutes dont use much . also sunscreen contains silica tend dry skin create almost masklike layer surface skin . probably helps zinc titanium active ingredients form protective layer renders sunscreen not water soluble . means cant really wash water water based cleanser . havent found bothersome youre bothered buildup may want get oilbased cleansercleansing oil get stuff completely off.overall satisfied sunscreen probably buy runs . good mineral sunscreen quirks .,"['ive', 'trying', 'stick', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'many', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', 'active', 'ingredients', 'endocrine', 'disruptors', 'harbor', 'risks', '.', 'includes', 'many', 'asian', 'sunscreens', 'like', 'biores', 'watery', 'essence', 'etc', '.', 'people', 'seem', 'rave', '.', 'bought', 'tinted', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'australian', 'gold', 'not', 'actually', 'australian', 'company', 'fyi', 'based', 'indianapolis', 'satisfied', 'reservations.pros', 'among', 'benign', 'ingredient', 'list', 'sunscreen', 'ive', 'found', 'free', 'problematic', 'chemical', 'sunscreens', 'like', 'oxybenzone', 'octinoxate', 'free', 'paba', 'reef', 'safe', 'etc', '.', 'terms', 'wearability', 'like', 'feels', 'like', 'nothing', 'skin', 'im', 'wearing', 'completely', 'physical', 'sunscreen', 'seems', 'protected', 'face', 'outdoors.cons', 'tint', 'may', 'not', 'work', 'skin', '.', 'darker', 'olive', 'skin', 'yellow', 'undertone', '.', 'tint', 'pale', 'pink', 'first', 'put', 'leave', 'pale', 'cast', '.', 'said', 'seems', 'blend', 'okay', 'minutes', 'dont', 'use', 'much', '.', 'also', 'sunscreen', 'contains', 'silica', 'tend', 'dry', 'skin', 'create', 'almost', 'masklike', 'layer', 'surface', 'skin', '.', 'probably', 'helps', 'zinc', 'titanium', 'active', 'ingredients', 'form', 'protective', 'layer', 'renders', 'sunscreen', 'not', 'water', 'soluble', '.', 'means', 'cant', 'really', 'wash', 'water', 'water', 'based', 'cleanser', '.', 'havent', 'found', 'bothersome', 'youre', 'bothered', 'buildup', 'may', 'want', 'get', 'oilbased', 'cleansercleansing', 'oil', 'get', 'stuff', 'completely', 'off.overall', 'satisfied', 'sunscreen', 'probably', 'buy', 'runs', '.', 'good', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'quirks', '.']"

i like using tinted sunscreen instead of foundation.  this one is not my favorite but only because i dont like the way it feels as much as i do some other brands.  even so the finish is nice it looks very natural.  its easy to spread on your skin and offers excellent protection from the sun. its a mineral sunscreen so it doesnt burn when you put it around your eyes.  ive never had any issues with skin sensitivity when i wear it no breakouts.i dont think it works well under foundation.when ive applied foundation over it the foundation seems to disturb the sunscreen layer and i get balled up goop.  though ive read other reviews that are of the opinion that it does work well under foundation so it could depend on your skin and the foundation you are using.  probably better to apply any other cream or liquid products over top of it with a sponge instead of rubbing in with your fingers so you dont disturb the sunscreen layer.  for me this product alone provides decent coverage and if i feel i need more coverage i just spot conceal with dermablend cream spf concealer.  eye makeup and blush or bronzer work fine over top of it.  a little sheer powder dusted over everything and im good to go. ,like using tinted sunscreen instead foundation . one not favorite dont like way feels much brands . even finish nice looks natural . easy spread skin offers excellent protection sun . mineral sunscreen doesnt burn put around eyes . ive never issues skin sensitivity wear no breakouts.i dont think works well foundation.when ive applied foundation foundation seems disturb sunscreen layer get balled goop . though ive read reviews opinion work well foundation could depend skin foundation using . probably better apply cream liquid products top sponge instead rubbing fingers dont disturb sunscreen layer . product alone provides decent coverage feel need coverage spot conceal dermablend cream spf concealer . eye makeup blush bronzer work fine top . little sheer powder dusted everything im good go .,"['like', 'using', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', 'instead', 'foundation', '.', 'one', 'not', 'favorite', 'dont', 'like', 'way', 'feels', 'much', 'brands', '.', 'even', 'finish', 'nice', 'looks', 'natural', '.', 'easy', 'spread', 'skin', 'offers', 'excellent', 'protection', 'sun', '.', 'mineral', 'sunscreen', 'doesnt', 'burn', 'put', 'around', 'eyes', '.', 'ive', 'never', 'issues', 'skin', 'sensitivity', 'wear', 'no', 'breakouts.i', 'dont', 'think', 'works', 'well', 'foundation.when', 'ive', 'applied', 'foundation', 'foundation', 'seems', 'disturb', 'sunscreen', 'layer', 'get', 'balled', 'goop', '.', 'though', 'ive', 'read', 'reviews', 'opinion', 'work', 'well', 'foundation', 'could', 'depend', 'skin', 'foundation', 'using', '.', 'probably', 'better', 'apply', 'cream', 'liquid', 'products', 'top', 'sponge', 'instead', 'rubbing', 'fingers', 'dont', 'disturb', 'sunscreen', 'layer', '.', 'product', 'alone', 'provides', 'decent', 'coverage', 'feel', 'need', 'coverage', 'spot', 'conceal', 'dermablend', 'cream', 'spf', 'concealer', '.', 'eye', 'makeup', 'blush', 'bronzer', 'work', 'fine', 'top', '.', 'little', 'sheer', 'powder', 'dusted', 'everything', 'im', 'good', 'go', '.']"

first of all this product with only 4 zinc oxide isnt enough to offer you a good sun protection. i have been using australian botanical medium to tan for awhile but its way too dark for me.  so i decided to mix it with my eucerin sensitive mineral sunscreenwith 24 zinc oxide.  i cant use this sunscreen alone because its too pasty and white so mixing it with the botanical medium to tan was giving me more protection and also lightening up the botanical.  even so the mixture was still a bit dark for me so i decided to try the botanical fair to light which is this product.  i dont see any tint at all.  it almost just blends in sheer which id rather have than a white pasty color but i really wish australian botanical made a light to medium product.  one is too light and the other too dark.  australian botanical would be the perfect product if they had a higher percentage of zinc oxide and a shade that was geared towards light to medium skin tones. doesnt give you enough protection,first product 4 zinc oxide isnt enough offer good sun protection . using australian botanical medium tan awhile way dark . decided mix eucerin sensitive mineral sunscreenwith 24 zinc oxide . cant use sunscreen alone pasty white mixing botanical medium tan giving protection also lightening botanical . even mixture still bit dark decided try botanical fair light product . dont see tint . almost blends sheer id rather white pasty color really wish australian botanical made light medium product . one light dark . australian botanical would perfect product higher percentage zinc oxide shade geared towards light medium skin tones . doesnt give enough protection,"['first', 'product', '4', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'isnt', 'enough', 'offer', 'good', 'sun', 'protection', '.', 'using', 'australian', 'botanical', 'medium', 'tan', 'awhile', 'way', 'dark', '.', 'decided', 'mix', 'eucerin', 'sensitive', 'mineral', 'sunscreenwith', '24', 'zinc', 'oxide', '.', 'cant', 'use', 'sunscreen', 'alone', 'pasty', 'white', 'mixing', 'botanical', 'medium', 'tan', 'giving', 'protection', 'also', 'lightening', 'botanical', '.', 'even', 'mixture', 'still', 'bit', 'dark', 'decided', 'try', 'botanical', 'fair', 'light', 'product', '.', 'dont', 'see', 'tint', '.', 'almost', 'blends', 'sheer', 'id', 'rather', 'white', 'pasty', 'color', 'really', 'wish', 'australian', 'botanical', 'made', 'light', 'medium', 'product', '.', 'one', 'light', 'dark', '.', 'australian', 'botanical', 'would', 'perfect', 'product', 'higher', 'percentage', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'shade', 'geared', 'towards', 'light', 'medium', 'skin', 'tones', '.', 'doesnt', 'give', 'enough', 'protection']"
i have sensitive skin with rosacea and it doesnt irritate my skin at all. i read a different review that it is streaky left swirls on their face but maybe its because they applied it with their hands or a brush. it works best if you apply it with a sponge beauty blender very seamless. i do set it with some powder right a a long my undereyes to avoid creasing.its great perfect for a pool day or even at the beach if you want some coverage and dont want to use foundation.coverage is a buildable light to mediumi would recommend this product to any sensitive to normal to oily skin types. maybe not dry skin because it dries down matte unless you make sure to moisturize generously before you use it. great for sensitive skin and if you want something waterproof,sensitive skin rosacea doesnt irritate skin . read different review streaky left swirls face maybe applied hands brush . works best apply sponge beauty blender seamless . set powder right long undereyes avoid creasing.its great perfect pool day even beach want coverage dont want use foundation.coverage buildable light mediumi would recommend product sensitive normal oily skin types . maybe not dry skin dries matte unless make sure moisturize generously use . great sensitive skin want something waterproof,"['sensitive', 'skin', 'rosacea', 'doesnt', 'irritate', 'skin', '.', 'read', 'different', 'review', 'streaky', 'left', 'swirls', 'face', 'maybe', 'applied', 'hands', 'brush', '.', 'works', 'best', 'apply', 'sponge', 'beauty', 'blender', 'seamless', '.', 'set', 'powder', 'right', 'long', 'undereyes', 'avoid', 'creasing.its', 'great', 'perfect', 'pool', 'day', 'even', 'beach', 'want', 'coverage', 'dont', 'want', 'use', 'foundation.coverage', 'buildable', 'light', 'mediumi', 'would', 'recommend', 'product', 'sensitive', 'normal', 'oily', 'skin', 'types', '.', 'maybe', 'not', 'dry', 'skin', 'dries', 'matte', 'unless', 'make', 'sure', 'moisturize', 'generously', 'use', '.', 'great', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'want', 'something', 'waterproof']"

broke me out and clog my pores. i debated whether to give this three or four stars.  it has the functionalities that i love but also has the side effects that i dislike.  i have very oily sensitive skin with enlarge pores and minimal amount of fine lines.  i dont wear makeup i use sunscreen and top with silica powder brow powder and off i go to work.  i did not change anything else in my daily routine.pros1 texture is great.  it feels like a whipped cream very light and barely has any scent.  putting it on isnt hard and no rubbing in involved.2 tinted but not dramatic.  the tint is barely there it can help with light redness and give you a natural look if used alone or a nice base for your makeup.3 nongreasy.  this is not greasy at all it dries matte but not dull.  your skin will look very normal.4 does not sit in fine lines or pore.  it doesnt sink into your pores or fine lines.  i have enlarge pores to the point that you can see my pores easily on a closeup.  this doesnt exaggerate my pore at all in fact it glides over them and blue them out.  of course anything bigger it wont be able to help.5 oil controlling.  i used this in an over 10 hour day humid boston day.  at eod the sunscreen on my tzone melted but that was pretty much it.  my oils gave me a natural glow rather than looking like a greasy pit.cons1 clog my pores.  i used this for a week and exfoliated like i normally would every wed and sun.  but i still had non pimple or whitehead bumps everywhere.  i also use micellar water to take this product off before using cetaphil to wash my face.  i thought it may be me over washing since exuviance daily protector is very hard to take off so i tone down my exfoliation.  that did not work out either.2 break outs.  of course break outs are in inevitable after a while.  end of the week i had one or two break outs.  they heal quickly but still its annoying that this gave me break outs.3 no skin care effects.  the product says it has vitamins and antioxidants to help protect the skin.  well lets just say my skin wasnt soft after using this for a week.  on top of the clogged pores there was just nothing that helped my skin.you may say well there are more pros then cons i should like it.  but ive dealt with acne all my lift.  the sight of a pimple annoys me it makes me feel like all my diligence in keeping my skin clear goes down the drain.  i wish this didnt clog my pores.  i will use this on and off til im done repurchase is a maybe.  i still recommend oily skin guys and gals give this a shot.  its very well priced and it may work for someone else even though it did not work for me. it has the functionalities that i love but also has the side effects that i dislike,broke clog pores . debated whether give three four stars . functionalities

this review is for the original universal tinted color so not the 3 new shades they came out with  although ive heard this original tint is equivalent to their new light shade.i initially heard about this sunscreen from the youtuber hot  flashy. i looked it up on amazon and wow the reviews are incredible so i had really high hopes unfortunately it didnt work out for me. ill explain why below but for reference i have sensitive skin that gets irritated if im not careful with products i started tretinoin a few months ago in march which is making my skin more sensitive dry to normal skin and im on the lighter end of medium skin tone with yellow undertones. i apply my sunscreens over my moisturizer and i reapply about every 3 hours since im indoors all day during quarantine. i do not wear any make up over my sunscreens.alright prosit is matte like actually really matte. so many mineral sunscreens claim to be matte but they end up looking oily and shiny on my face and never settle during the day. this one actually dried extremely fast did not transfer onto my hand if i touched my face and it was totally matte. it looked nice. this is tough to find and i was so impressed by the formula.its super cheap mineral sunscreens can be very expensiveit leaves no white castconsfragrance it claims to be fragrance free but that is an unregulated term. this product has eucalyptus leaf extract. this is pointless to put into this product  they could formulate it without this extract. but i get it. they want to keep up with the whole australian vibe even though this product is not actually australian. when i started my tret. journey i went super in depth into research about what is good for our skin and what is not. things like fragrance essential oils etc in face products can be extremely irritating for some skin types. and im one of those skin types. i initially was hesitant to buy this because of the eucalyptus extract. its in the middle of the ingredient list which means there is a pretty good amount of this in the product. i am pretty sure this is what caused my breakouts and irritation in addition to the thick formula see next two cons.breakoutsirritation by the middle of the day i noticed by face was feeling a bit heavy around the cheek area and my pores did not feel like they could breathe. my skin literally felt clogged. when i washed off my face at night i had 3 new and small pimples that appeared on my cheeks two on my chin and some red patches.thick consistency formula this product is super thick its not light weight or breathable at all especially if you apply it every 2 hours as intended for proper sun protection. after one application i noticed my face looked pretty nice and almost like i had a layer of foundation. by the second layer i looked like i had straight up cake face.doesnt play nice with hairline if you accidentally get this product on your eyebrows eyelashes because yes you need to apply sunscreen to your eyelids too near your hairline. good luck. i had white looking eyelashes the whole day and couldnt get it off my eyelashes because the formula is so thick. i dont wear mascara either so i couldnt cover it up. i looked very strange.tint lastly the universal tint was very off for my skin tone. which isnt a deal breaker because if this product worked i couldve always bought the mediumtan option from their new tints. if you have pink undertones this will work well for you. the undertones in this tint are very pink and because i have yellow undertones you could clearly see near my hairline and on my neck where the sunscreen startedstopped.if you read through all this wow you rock. haha. i hope its helpful for some. if you have non sensitive skin pink undertones and dont mind a thickfoundation looking sunscreen. this is probably for you i wish it worked for me. my holy grail and recommendation over this is supergoop mattescreen. its amazing and i have no negatives to say about that. but it is so so much more expensive. good luck on your sunscreen journey heavy  caused clogged pores acne,review original universal tinted color not 3 new shades came although ive heard original tint equivalent new

okay so i like makeup that stays on. i dont want to touch up etc however most makeup like this is for oily skin and is very drying. i am 5 months pregnant which means i am more dry than the already dry i was just living in arizona. so how i make this work is i put the 2 aha paulas choice body lotion in the purple bottle on my face first then i use the snail mucin moisturizer thats recently been popular. then i use the lightest shade of this stuff all over my face and neck on top of that then i use the darkest shade of this sunscreen as my tanner. thennnnn it dries and i look like a wrinkly old lady because this stuff is drying. but the color is great and its not makeup so it makes me happy. then i have to no joke put the first aid kit moisturizer sold at sephora for cheap allll over the top of it. then i put under eye cream thickly under my eyes to keep hydrated then i top it off with the walmart glotion in the rose gold color. and thats how i achieve this skin protected but moisturized look in the photo with no real face makeup i did see the comment saying they just put a bunch of oil on their face before this sunscreen and ill try that monday to see if it works with less steps. overall tho its good sunscreen with a nice coverage once its dry and im never buying foundation or powder again. can work for dry skin,okay like makeup stays . dont want touch etc however makeup like oily skin drying . 5 months pregnant means dry already dry living arizona . make work put 2 aha paulas choice body lotion purple bottle face first use snail mucin moisturizer thats recently popular . use lightest shade stuff face neck top use darkest shade sunscreen tanner . thennnnn dries look like wrinkly old lady stuff drying . color great not makeup makes happy . no joke put first aid kit moisturizer sold sephora cheap allll top . put eye cream thickly eyes keep hydrated top walmart glotion rose gold color . thats achieve skin protected moisturized look photo no real face makeup see comment saying put bunch oil face sunscreen ill try monday see works less steps . overall tho good sunscreen nice coverage dry im never buying foundation powder . work dry skin,"['okay', 'like', 'makeup', 'stays', '.', 'dont', 'want', 'touch', 'etc', 'however', 'makeup', 'like', 'oily', 'skin', 'drying', '.', '5', 'months', 'pregnant', 'means', 'dry', 'already', 'dry', 'living', 'arizona', '.', 'make', 'work', 'put', '2', 'aha', 'paulas', 'choice', 'body', 'lotion', 'purple', 'bottle', 'face', 'first', 'use', 'snail', 'mucin', 'moisturizer', 'thats', 'recently', 'popular', '.', 'use', 'lightest', 'shade', 'stuff', 'face', 'neck', 'top', 'use', 'darkest', 'shade', 'sunscreen', 'tanner', '.', 'thennnnn', 'dries', 'look', 'like', 'wrinkly', 'old', 'lady', 'stuff', 'drying', '.', 'color', 'great', 'not', 'makeup', 'makes', 'happy', '.', 'no', 'joke', 'put', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'moisturizer', 'sold', 'sephora', 'cheap', 'allll', 'top', '.', 'put', 'eye', 'cream', 'thickly', 'eyes', 'keep', 'hydrated', 'top', 'walmart', 'glotion', 'rose', 'gold', 'color', '.', 'thats', 'achieve', 'skin', 'protected', 'moisturized', 'look', 'photo', 'no', 'real', 'face', 'makeup', 'see', 'comment', 'saying', 'put', 'bunch', 'oil', 'face', 'sunscreen', 'ill', 'try', 'monday', 'see', 'works', 'less', 'steps', '.', 'overall', 'tho', 'good', 'sunscreen', 'nice', 'coverage', 'dry', 'im', 'never', 'buying', 'foundation', 'powder', '.', 'work', 'dry', 'skin']"

i was looking for a tinted moisturizer  mineral sunblock that was totally nontoxic and could serve as bb cream and this seemed to fit the bill.  i didnt pay attention to the waterresistant part. even though the sunblock is mineral rather than chemical to get this product waterresistant they have to add chemicals that are not so great. that was disappointing.i would not use this product if you were hoping to wear it under your makeup or to blend it with any other bb cream or foundation. it does not blend. it needs to be used alone or with only powder over.  even so it doesnt seem to absorb or blend into the skin perfectly although it is acceptable. if you put other makeup over it there will be swirls of product that just sit there and look ugly.  thats the trouble with water resistance.this product does not have a fragrance but its natural smell is somewhat noticeable though very mild and i would describe the smell as chalky or frostinglike.  i feel like i am smelling the waterresistant chemical. its not bothersome but its also not my favorite thing.if you are using this product by itself while it doesnt provide a lot of coverage it does a nice job of moisturizing and softening the face. it can provide a nice base for maybe a little concealer and powder. as far as i know it is sun protective though i havent really tested it for that. im sure the waterresistance would come in handy for your watersports in the summertime.all in all my major complaint is the fact that the words water resistant are so small on the bottle that i didnt notice. i only took one star away because this is about my preference and not necessarily anything wrong with the product. water resistant  not blendable  toxic,looking tinted moisturizer mineral sunblock totally nontoxic could serve bb cream seemed fit bill . didnt pay attention waterresistant part . even though sunblock mineral rather chemical get product waterresistant add chemicals not great . disappointing.i would not use product hoping wear makeup blend bb cream foundation . not blend . needs used alone powder . even doesnt seem absorb blend skin perfectly although acceptable . put makeup swirls product sit look ugly . thats trouble water resistance.this product not fragrance natural smell somewhat noticeable though mild would describe smell chalky frostinglike . feel like smelling waterresistant chemical . not bothersome also not favorite thing.if using product doesnt provide lot coverage nice job moisturizing softening face . provide nice base maybe little concealer powder . far know sun protective though havent really tested . im sure waterresistance would come handy watersports summertime.all major complaint fact words water resistant small bottle didnt notice . took one star away preference not necessarily anything wrong product . water resistant not blendable toxic,"['looking', 'tinted', 'moisturizer', 'mineral', 'sunblock', 'totally', 'nontoxic', 'could', 'serve', 'bb', 'cream', 'seemed', 'fit', 'bill', '.', 'didnt', 'pay', 'attention', 'waterresistant', 'part', '.', 'even', 'though', 'sunblock', 'mineral', 'rather', 'chemical', 'get', 'product', 'waterresistant', 'add', 'chemicals', 'not', 'great', '.', 'disappointing.i', 'would', 'not', 'use', 'product', 'hoping', 'wear', 'makeup', 'blend', 'bb', 'cream', 'foundation', '.', 'not', 'blend', '.', 'needs', 'used', 'alone', 'powder', '.', 'even', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'absorb', 'blend', 'skin', 'perfectly', 'although', 'acceptable', '.', 'put', 'makeup', 'swirls', 'product', 'sit', 'look', 'ugly', '.', 'thats', 'trouble', 'water', 'resistance.this', 'product', 'not', 'fragrance', 'natural', 'smell', 'somewhat', 'noticeable', 'though', 'mild', 'would', 'describe', 'smell', 'chalky', 'frostinglike', '.', 'feel', 'like', 'smelling', 'waterresistant', 'chemical', '.', 'not', 'bothersome', 'also', 'not', 'favorite', 'thing.if', 'using', 'product', 'doesnt', 'provide', 'lot', 'coverage', 'nice', 'job', 'moisturizing', 'softening', 'face', '.', 'provide', 'nice', 'base', 'maybe', 'little', 'concealer', 'powder', '.', 'far', 'know', 'sun', 'protective', 'though', 'havent', 'really', 'tested', '.', 'im', 'sure', 'waterresistance', 'would', 'come', 'handy', 'watersports', 'summertime.all', 'major', 'complaint', 'fact', 'words', 'water', 'resistant', 'small', 'bottle', 'didnt', 'notice', '.', 'took', 'one', 'star', 'away', 'preference', 'not', 'necessarily', 'anything', 'wrong', 'product', '.', 'water', 'resistant', 'not', 'blendable', 'toxic']"

im a swim instructor and lifeguard at the ymca and i spend between 4 and 7 seven hours in the sun and pool 5 days a week. i also have incredibly sensitive skin some chemical sunscreens make me break out with rosacea cystic hormonal breakouts dryness and t zone oiliness so ive got a lot on my face thatim interested in covering up. many of the neutrogena sunscreens run into my eyes when i get in the pool to teach and they wash off after an hour and i burn badly. when i reapply it even after waiting 1520 min before getting my face wet to let it soak in it still runs into my eyes and i usually burn through many of them. this product doesnt run because its a very thick consistency and since its zinc and not a chemical sunscreen i dont break out as badly. usually zinc sunscreens leave a white cast but since this is tinted it doesnt leave the white cast and actually helps keep my skin tone even in the pool where i dont have the option of wearing concealer or something to cover my breakouts. its so thick that it stays on even if you rub your face with your hands and it does take a couple washes to fully remove from your face. one thing i will say this doesnt come in different shade options  there is one single shade and its very obviously designed for light to medium skin tones. a person with a medium to deep skin tone would probably not be able to wear this without a paleorange cast on the skin. im quite pale with lots of redness so when i use it it looks very tan on me because im a little too pale for the shade but once i rub it in it isnt as intense as it looks when you first see it out of the tube. it appears orange in some lighting but even on me once its properly rubbed in it isnt orange anymore. i started using this about 2 months ago. my skin has been difficult recently so i have been getting some new breakouts while using this product over the last two months however im fairly sure its because of hormones not the sunscreen.overall i would recommend this to anyone with light to medium skin tones who wants a thick powerful sunscreen that lasts and thats not chemical but without the white cast. longlasting no white cast good mineral formula no breakouts on

i was very impressed with australian gold tinted sunscreen. i have sensitive skin and can rarely use chemical sunscreens because when they react with sunlight it causes a rash on my skin. ive tried many many different mineralbased sunblocks over the years and this is my favorite.it stays on strong even through heavy perspiration. i use it while gardening and hiking and it never runs. i havent burned yet. it is so persistent in fact that washing with soap and water still leaves quite a bit on my skin. i have no doubt it would stay on while swimming. but the remnants left on my face after washing dont bother me. after showering or washing my face i just use a cotton pad soaked in toner and its gone.another surprising attribute of this lotion is how well it matches my skin tone. i am of asian heritage and have always had trouble finding foundations or powders that dont make my face pink. this lotion does not stand out on my skin. it doesnt look unnaturally rosy like im wearing makeup or have a white kabuki mask on. my least favorite part of mineral sunscreens is how pasty white or even lavender they would appear on my skin. australian gold tinted doesnt have that problem at all for me.a final plus is that this lotion does not promote acne. i have used cetaphil oil control spf moisturizer and it caused me to breakout in little pimples all over my face.ive also used mineralbased spf bb creams such as physicians formula and while they dont irritate my skin or cause breakouts they tend not to stay in place when i sweat.this australian gold botanical face sunscreen behaves much more like a foundation than an ordinary sunscreen. its got a lightweight feel and matte finish that makes it very pleasant to wear. just beware it will stain white clothing and has not been easy to wash out.this is the best mineral sunscreen ive used yet. i only wish it were available in a larger bottle i would use it all over my body if it didnt cost so much.australian gold botanical sunscreen spf 50 mineral lotion 5 fl oz  4 stars. i also purchased the larger bottle of body mineral sunscreen. didnt like it as much. unlike the tinted face lotion it does leave a pale hue on my skin. however its not nearly as bad as neutrogena sensitive skin sunscreen. if the neutrogenas whiteness is a 10 australian gold body mineral sunscreen is about a 4. the color is kind of a faint whitishpink. at least its not thick white or purplish like some mineral sunblocks.a big plus from both these lotions from australian gold is they go on with a powdery nongreasy finish they dont feel heavy sticky or oily at all like many other sunscreens and they dont leave my hands slippery.also the body mineral lotion seems to be even more stubborn than the face sunscreen. after showering and despite using a pouf to scrub myself there were still white lines in the nooks and crevices of my skin. i definitely prefer the face mineral lotion from this brand. would give the body sunscreen 4 stars if i could review the two separately. stays on through sweat and even matches my skin tone,impressed australian gold tinted sunscreen . sensitive skin rarely use chemical sunscreens react

happy with this product.  i have super sensitive skin and this has not irritated my face at all.  it is tinted sort of but blends in really well and doesnt look like you have foundation on.  but it evens out my skin tone a little.  i feel it is long lasting and protects well.  it only feels a tad dry on my face.  it is a little harder to wash off at the end of the day so use a gentle scrubbie or washcloth andor mycellar water.  i will buy again. good for my sensitive skin,happy product . super sensitive skin not irritated face . tinted sort blends really well doesnt look like foundation . evens skin tone little . feel long lasting protects well . feels tad dry face . little harder wash end day use gentle scrubbie washcloth andor mycellar water . buy . good sensitive skin,"['happy', 'product', '.', 'super', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'not', 'irritated', 'face', '.', 'tinted', 'sort', 'blends', 'really', 'well', 'doesnt', 'look', 'like', 'foundation', '.', 'evens', 'skin', 'tone', 'little', '.', 'feel', 'long', 'lasting', 'protects', 'well', '.', 'feels', 'tad', 'dry', 'face', '.', 'little', 'harder', 'wash', 'end', 'day', 'use', 'gentle', 'scrubbie', 'washcloth', 'andor', 'mycellar', 'water', '.', 'buy', '.', 'good', 'sensitive', 'skin']"

i do really like this a lot. it spreads easily and gives a nice sheer tint to my face. i have pretty sensitive skin and its super gentle. if you have a really oily face though i would not recommend since that sheerness can look too oily. i have pretty dry skin so it works. i would say its not as moisturizing as i thought but its not a deal breaker for me. it does have a slight weird smell to it but also doesnt bother me  i feel like many eucerin products are like that for some reason. for reference i have light olive skin tone and normal to dry skin. ,really like lot . spreads easily gives nice sheer tint face . pretty sensitive skin super gentle . really oily face though would not recommend since sheerness look oily . pretty dry skin works . would say not moisturizing thought not deal breaker . slight weird smell also doesnt bother feel like many eucerin products like reason . reference light olive skin tone normal dry skin .,"['really', 'like', 'lot', '.', 'spreads', 'easily', 'gives', 'nice', 'sheer', 'tint', 'face', '.', 'pretty', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'super', 'gentle', '.', 'really', 'oily', 'face', 'though', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'since', 'sheerness', 'look', 'oily', '.', 'pretty', 'dry', 'skin', 'works', '.', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'moisturizing', 'thought', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', '.', 'slight', 'weird', 'smell', 'also', 'doesnt', 'bother', 'feel', 'like', 'many', 'eucerin', 'products', 'like', 'reason', '.', 'reference', 'light', 'olive', 'skin', 'tone', 'normal', 'dry', 'skin', '.']"

i have tried a lot of sunscreens over the last year. i mostly use zinc oxide types from the us and japanese sunscreens. this is a really nice zinc oxide. the pros are you can pick your tint it has nice coverage does not pill this was a problem with an expensive brandthe tint is great on my skin i can sometimes use this as a moisturizer too and i love the amount of zinc oxide and other ingredients. cons are it is a little runny for the packaging it is a little shiny some people may like this but i put powder on top and it helps and the price per ounce actually makes this almost as expensive as the stuff sold in dermatologists office. i would say the pros outweigh the cons as i bought a second bottle during prime day and i had only been using the first for about two weeks. ,tried lot sunscreens last year . mostly use zinc oxide types us japanese sunscreens . really nice zinc oxide . pros pick tint nice coverage not pill problem expensive brandthe tint great skin sometimes use moisturizer love amount zinc oxide ingredients . cons little runny packaging little shiny people may like put powder top helps price per ounce actually makes almost expensive stuff sold dermatologists office . would say pros outweigh cons bought second bottle prime day using first two weeks .,"['tried', 'lot', 'sunscreens', 'last', 'year', '.', 'mostly', 'use', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'types', 'us', 'japanese', 'sunscreens', '.', 'really', 'nice', 'zinc', 'oxide', '.', 'pros', 'pick', 'tint', 'nice', 'coverage', 'not', 'pill', 'problem', 'expensive', 'brandthe', 'tint', 'great', 'skin', 'sometimes', 'use', 'moisturizer', 'love', 'amount', 'zinc', 'oxide', 'ingredients', '.', 'cons', 'little', 'runny', 'packaging', 'little', 'shiny', 'people', 'may', 'like', 'put', 'powder', 'top', 'helps', 'price', 'per', 'ounce', 'actually', 'makes', 'almost', 'expensive', 'stuff', 'sold', 'dermatologists', 'office', '.', 'would', 'say', 'pros', 'outweigh', 'cons', 'bought', 'second', 'bottle', 'prime', 'day', 'using', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', '.']"

i found out about this sunscreen through angie from her hot and flashy youtube channel. she did a video earlier this year where she covered a bunch of different products to find her favorite face sunscreen. she did at least 20 high end and drugstore and this was her favorite so naturally i had to try it and she was right this is a great product especially for a barrier sunscreen. the barrier ingredients used in the us are inferior to the europe and asia so that makes them difficult to blend and often dry with a white cast. this product both blends well and does not dry my skin out. it is hydrating too which is great for my dry sensitive skin. the light shade is pretty light and there is a pretty big difference between that and the medium. so depending on the of the year i may use one or the other or do a blend of the two. i also love that i can wear this on its own if i dont feel like wearing makeup and it leaves just a hint of tinted coverage. since this is a hydrating sunscreen it does leave a dewy glow on its own. i would suggest still using a primer on top of it if you plan to wear foundation. i have repurchased this three times already so it has become a staple in my daily routine. great prod uct please dont discontinue it neutrogena my most favorite sunscreen,found sunscreen angie hot flashy youtube channel . video earlier year covered bunch different products find favorite face sunscreen . least 20 high end drugstore favorite naturally try right great product especially barrier sunscreen . barrier ingredients used us inferior europe asia makes difficult blend often dry white cast . product blends well not dry skin . hydrating great dry sensitive skin . light shade pretty light pretty big difference medium . depending year may use one blend two . also love wear dont feel like wearing makeup leaves hint tinted coverage . since hydrating sunscreen leave dewy glow . would suggest still using primer top plan wear foundation . repurchased three times already become staple daily routine . great prod uct please dont discontinue neutrogena favorite sunscreen,"['found', 'sunscreen', 'angie', 'hot', 'flashy', 'youtube', 'channel', '.', 'video', 'earlier', 'year', 'covered', 'bunch', 'different', 'products', 'find', 'favorite', 'face', 'sunscreen', '.', 'least', '20', 'high', 'end', 'drugstore', 'favorite', 'naturally', 'try', 'right', 'great', 'product', 'especially', 'barrier', 'sunscreen', '.', 'barrier', 'ingredients', 'used', 'us', 'inferior', 'europe', 'asia', 'makes', 'difficult', 'blend', 'often', 'dry', 'white', 'cast', '.', 'product', 'blends', 'well', 'not', 'dry', 'skin', '.', 'hydrating', 'great', 'dry', 'sensitive', 'skin', '.', 'light', 'shade', 'pretty', 'light', 'pretty', 'big', 'difference', 'medium', '.', 'depending', 'year', 'may', 'use', 'one', 'blend', 'two', '.', 'also', 'love', 'wear', 'dont', 'feel', 'like', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'leaves', 'hint', 'tinted', 'coverage', '.', 'since', 'hydrating', 'sunscreen', 'leave', 'dewy', 'glow', '.', 'would', 'suggest', 'still', 'using', 'primer', 'top', 'plan', 'wear', 'foundation', '.', 'repurchased', 'three', 'times', 'already', 'become', 'staple', 'daily', 'routine', '.', 'great', 'prod', 'uct', 'please', 'dont', 'discontinue', 'neutrogena', 'favorite', 'sunscreen']"

this product is pretty troublesome well for one the product packaging is literally disintegrating from the sunscreen. what i mean by this is when the sunscreen touches the outside packaging of like the paint or whatever it literally rubs it off with hardly any pressure.two the product is grotesquely overpriced considering the only thing special about it is that it smells good. i get it has better ingredients and stuff but its going on your body so thats not nearly that important not like it makes a big difference anyways considering its still kind of a greasy sunscreen. while were on the topic of it being greasy it should not be used on your face because it frequently would seep into my mouth andor eyes obviously this is very unpleasant.to use this sunscreen with the recommended amount needing daily you would need easily a new bottle every month which would be 264 dollars a year including tax. ,product pretty troublesome well one product packaging literally disintegrating sunscreen . mean sunscreen touches outside packaging like paint whatever literally rubs hardly pressure.two product grotesquely overpriced considering thing special smells good . get better ingredients stuff going body thats not nearly important not like makes big difference anyways considering still kind greasy sunscreen . topic greasy not used face frequently would seep mouth andor eyes obviously unpleasant.to use sunscreen recommended amount needing daily would need easily new bottle every month would 264 dollars year including tax .,"['product', 'pretty', 'troublesome', 'well', 'one', 'product', 'packaging', 'literally', 'disintegrating', 'sunscreen', '.', 'mean', 'sunscreen', 'touches', 'outside', 'packaging', 'like', 'paint', 'whatever', 'literally', 'rubs', 'hardly', 'pressure.two', 'product', 'grotesquely', 'overpriced', 'considering', 'thing', 'special', 'smells', 'good', '.', 'get', 'better', 'ingredients', 'stuff', 'going', 'body', 'thats', 'not', 'nearly', 'important', 'not', 'like', 'makes', 'big', 'difference', 'anyways', 'considering', 'still', 'kind', 'greasy', 'sunscreen', '.', 'topic', 'greasy', 'not', 'used', 'face', 'frequently', 'would', 'seep', 'mouth', 'andor', 'eyes', 'obviously', 'unpleasant.to', 'use', 'sunscreen', 'recommended', 'amount', 'needing', 'daily', 'would', 'need', 'easily', 'new', 'bottle', 'every', 'month', 'would', '264', 'dollars', 'year', 'including', 'tax', '.']"

the product smells nice doesnt leave a greasy feeling on my skin. its easy to spread and seeps right into my skin. ive had bad luck with sunscreens and so far this one has been nice on my sensitive skin.the quality of the bottles is odd or at least that was my first impression. it feels cheap. maybe thats just how this product is.edit i made this review back when my skin care routine consisted on nothing but salicylic acid cleanser and this sunscreen every other day whenever i remembered to apply it. my skin was dry and this sunscreen felt like heaven when applied on my screen.i recently started actually looking after my skin and added a moisturizer and retinol to my routine. my skin is now hydrated and soft. now im having to switch to a different sunscreen because this one can no longer be fully absorbed by face. it leaves a nice glow but also an unfortunate greasy feeling on my skin. i also forgot to point our last time that it does leave a white cast but it goes away after a few extra seconds of rubbing it in.i still think this is a good product just make sure you have the right skin type dry for it. not for oily  combo skin types,product smells nice doesnt leave greasy feeling skin . easy spread seeps right skin . ive bad luck sunscreens far one nice sensitive skin.the quality bottles odd least first impression . feels cheap . maybe thats product is.edit made review back skin care routine consisted nothing salicylic acid cleanser sunscreen every day whenever remembered apply . skin dry sunscreen felt like heaven applied screen.i recently started actually looking skin added moisturizer retinol routine . skin hydrated soft . im switch different sunscreen one no longer fully absorbed face . leaves nice glow also unfortunate greasy feeling skin . also forgot point last time leave white cast goes away extra seconds rubbing in.i still think good product make sure right skin type dry . not oily combo skin types,"['product', 'smells', 'nice', 'doesnt', 'leave', 'greasy', 'feeling', 'skin', '.', 'easy', 'spread', 'seeps', 'right', 'skin', '.', 'ive', 'bad', 'luck', 'sunscreens', 'far', 'one', 'nice', 'sensitive', 'skin.the', 'quality', 'bottles', 'odd', 'least', 'first', 'impression', '.', 'feels', 'cheap', '.', 'maybe', 'thats', 'product', 'is.edit', 'made', 'review', 'back', 'skin', 'care', 'routine', 'consisted', 'nothing', 'salicylic', 'acid', 'cleanser', 'sunscreen', 'every', 'day', 'whenever', 'remembered', 'apply', '.', 'skin', 'dry', 'sunscreen', 'felt', 'like', 'heaven', 'applied', 'screen.i', 'recently', 'started', 'actually', 'looking', 'skin', 'added', 'moisturizer', 'retinol', 'routine', '.', 'skin', 'hydrated', 'soft', '.', 'im', 'switch', 'different', 'sunscreen', 'one', 'no', 'longer', 'fully', 'absorbed', 'face', '.', 'leaves', 'nice', 'glow', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'greasy', 'feeling', 'skin', '.', 'also', 'forgot', 'point', 'last', 'time', 'leave', 'white', 'cast', 'goes', 'away', 'extra', 'seconds', 'rubbing', 'in.i', 'still', 'think', 'good', 'product', 'make', 'sure', 'right', 'skin', 'type', 'dry', '.', 'not', 'oily', 'combo', 'skin', 'types']"

i love the tinted elta md but i cannot afford 3040 per bottle of sunscreen i just cant so ive been on the hunt for something else in a drugstore price that will suffice.i do not have sensitive skin in general but sunscreen regularly burns my face so i have to be super careful with what i use.im also on tretinoin so my skin is extra vulnerable to burning so i must wear sunscreen  on my face  ive always hated it in the past so didnt use it i regret that now.anyway  this stuff is legit. i like it aaaaaalmost as well as my tinted elta md samples at a fraction of the price. my skin is still semipurging and not totally clear so i love that it helps concealblur my skin imperfections. it makes it easier for me to skip foundation  my skin is protected and it conceals my ick lol.i have never burned with this sunscreen on either. i am active and spend a lot of time in the sun  working in the yard working out outside bootcamp style etc and zero burns.im only removing one star because it tends to transfer easily onto clothing etc and can be a bit of a pita to remove. i use micellar water as the first part of a double cleanse and that helps a lot.  also i know for some it makes them look a little orange thankfully i am fair but not ultra light skinned and it suits my skin tone well  i tend to have slight warm undertones and this just works well for me no oompa loompa orange hue for me thankfully. after 4 months of testing  this is my new holy grail,love tinted elta md not afford 3040 per bottle sunscreen cant ive hunt something else drugstore price suffice.i not sensitive skin general sunscreen regularly burns face super careful use.im also tretinoin skin extra vulnerable burning must wear sunscreen face ive always hated past didnt use regret now.anyway stuff legit . like aaaaaalmost well tinted elta md samples fraction price . skin still semipurging not totally clear love helps concealblur skin imperfections . makes easier skip foundation skin protected conceals ick lol.i never burned sunscreen either . active spend lot time sun working yard working outside bootcamp style etc zero burns.im removing one star tends transfer easily onto clothing etc bit pita remove . use micellar water first part double cleanse helps lot . also know makes look little orange thankfully fair not ultra light skinned suits skin tone well tend slight warm undertones works well no oompa loompa orange hue thankfully . 4 months testing new holy grail,"['love', 'tinted', 'elta', 'md', 'not', 'afford', '3040', 'per', 'bottle', 'sunscreen', 'cant', 'ive', 'hunt', 'something', 'else', 'drugstore', 'price', 'suffice.i', 'not', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'general', 'sunscreen', 'regularly', 'burns', 'face', 'super', 'careful', 'use.im', 'also', 'tretinoin', 'skin', 'extra', 'vulnerable', 'burning', 'must', 'wear', 'sunscreen', 'face', 'ive', 'always', 'hated', 'past', 'didnt', 'use', 'regret', 'now.anyway', 'stuff', 'legit', '.', 'like', 'aaaaaalmost', 'well', 'tinted', 'elta', 'md', 'samples', 'fraction', 'price', '.', 'skin', 'still', 'semipurging', 'not', 'totally', 'clear', 'love', 'helps', 'concealblur', 'skin', 'imperfections', '.', 'makes', 'easier', 'skip', 'foundation', 'skin', 'protected', 'conceals', 'ick', 'lol.i', 'never', 'burned', 'sunscreen', 'either', '.', 'active', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'sun', 'working', 'yard', 'working', 'outside', 'bootcamp', 'style', 'etc', 'zero', 'burns.im', 'removing', 'one', 'star', 'tends', 'transfer', 'easily', 'onto', 'clothing', 'etc', 'bit', 'pita', 'remove', '.', 'use', 'micellar', 'water', 'first', 'part', 'double', 'cleanse', 'helps', 'lot', '.', 'also', 'know', 'makes', 'look', 'little', 'orange', 'thankfully', 'fair', 'not', 'ultra', 'light', 'skinned', 'suits', 'skin', 'tone', 'well', 'tend', 'slight', 'warm', 'undertones', 'works', 'well', 'no', 'oompa', 'loompa', 'orange', 'hue', 'thankfully', '.', '4', 'months', 'testing', 'new', 'holy', 'grail']"
im a seasoned chemical sunscreens user. im in my early 40s and have been wearing some sort of sunscreen quasidaily since my early 20s. i can remember a time when good facial sunscreens were hard to get when i had to order products from spain or france and hope they made it through customs before amazon brought the world of skincare to us before the american cosmetic brands wised up to the fact that if they make better products well buy them. now we have a vast array of choices which is a great thing a sunscreen for everyone. no excuse to not protect ones self on a daily basis. i decided recently to make the switch to a more environmentally responsible reef safe sunscreen even though my husband loves to remind me that ive never been to a coral reef and the closest one is thousands of miles away weve all seen finding nemo all drains lead to the ocean. i tried this suncreen because the reviews were generally positive and i liked that it was a multitasker that could potentially even my skin tone. i absolutely love this sunscreen. i look forward to putting it on in the morning hugely important since it has to be applied to be effective. it feels creamy and rich but dries to a semimatte finish. the tone is just pigmented enough to help my rosaceaprone skin look less pink. and it comes in a fatfeeling three ounce tube for a great price. my only complaint for which i took off one star is that it feels a little heavy on my skin im conscious of rubbing my face against things like a scarf the hood of a jacket etc. it does transfer slightly and i dont like that. i havent used enough physical sunscreens to know if this is typical of them all or just an australian gold problem but i will repurchase this one anyway maybe i just need to apply less i use about a chickpea sized dollop and rub it in well.  the pluses outweigh the one minus and its not enough for me to waste money experimenting when im very happy with this one. possible hg material for me,im seasoned chemical

i have always been hesitant to wear a daily sunscreen since my skin breaks out easily and tends to be oily but now that ive reached my early 30s i decided it was time to get serious about skin protection. i tried this product on a whim after reading some other positive reviews and i love this sunscreen for a multitude of reasons1 it provides great sun protection. i wore this on my face while on vacation in the caribbean and got zero sunburn on my face while my shoulders simultaneously burned to a crisp while wearing a different spf 30 lotion. it seems to be quite water resistant as well since my face did not burn even after id been in the water.2 it is absolutely not greasy in fact i feel that this sunscreen leaves my skin feeling less oily at the end of a long hot day. my skin feels smooth and looks matte after applying this product it is definitely not shiny and greasy like some sunscreens are3 the tint is very subtle and mostly fades to nothing after you apply it. before i began using the product i was worried about the color of the tint since it appears to be a pinkish tan while my skins undertone is a yellowish tan. ultimately i have not noticed any color mismatch between this product and my skin tone it does not leave you looking like youre wearing makeup or foundation.4 this product is advertised as being fragrancefree which it is i dont like scented products as they tend to give me a headache after a few hours and this products light lotion smell disappears once youve applied it.5 the only very minor critique i have with this product is that it does not hydrate my dry skin very well. when my cheeks were dry in the winter i had to also use my nonsunscreen moisturizer as this product left my areas of dry skin still looking dry.i have been very satisfied with this product and i would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a daily sunscreen that protects your skin and does not look greasy. ,always hesitant wear daily sunscreen since
