i was offered a free trial of this product and decided to take the plunge  there are a lot of things to like about it  use does to brighten skin and lift both dead skin debris and oil well from combination skin which are two issues for me  i also have sensitive skin and found that this toner was not irritating or dryingon the negative side the cost is extremely high for active ingredients which can be found inexpensively in other products witch hazel which sells for less than a dollar for a large bottle and salicylic acid which is found in inexpensive products made by stridex and neutrogena as well as wart removers  i think the only thing that can account for this high price is a marketing campaigneffort to portray this as a luxury product its ingredients are fairy run of the mill and several have safety questions related to themfor example sodium benzoate is a salt of benzoic acid  benzoic acid is a substance which occurs naturally in many plants including most berries and especially cranberries and animals discovered in the 16th century and its dry distillation was first described by nostradamus in 1556  in cosmetics it may be used as a fragrance ingredient a ph adjuster or a preservative  salts of benzoic acid are used as food preservatives which inhibit the growth of mold yeast and some bacteria  excessive use in dried and pickled human foods has the potential to affect the liver and kidneys  benzoic acid is produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene an industrial solvent octane booster in gasoline and agent for breaking open red blood cells to extract hemoglobin in lab experiments with oxygen  it has been laboratory tested on rats mice and cats  it is believed to be safe for humans at moderate levels of ingestion but i am not so sure i want to adjust the ph of my skin with partially oxidized industrial solventsgreen purslane or portulaca extract seems to have many potential uses see pub med for 122 scientific articles but little is known about its safety or action when used in a cosmetic  its reported to be a humectant or skin protectant but what does that really mean in terms of how it acts on the skin to moisturize or protect  i also have some concerns about glycols  according to cosmeticinfo dot org butylene glycol is a solvent  the environmental protection agency cautions against excessive contact with the glycols included due to liver brain and other impacts so you may want to think carefully about that given that they are found in increasing numbers of cosmetics  the fact that this products makes users more prone to sunburn is another downside same active ingredients found in much less expensive products and a few concerns,offered free trial product decided take plunge lot things like use

most toners ive tried have a similar consistency in the liquid wet like water this one seems unique in that it applies almost oily but isnt actually oilyit comes out in tiny droplets and applies onto your skin like the consistency of oily products making it easier to apply than watery products id normally be wary of this because that tends to lead to residue left on the skin or slow absorption however it dried almost immediately and left zero residue no oily feeling no stickinessit also is virtually scentless unless you are directly sniffing the product from the bottle i prefer scentless products so this is a big plus for me i also have sensitive skin and notice zero redness or itchiness after using this producti think i may have found a new favorite toner fast absorption easy application scentless no residue and no sensitivity issues ,toners ive tried similar consistency liquid wet like water one seems unique applies almost oily isnt actually oilyit comes tiny droplets applies onto skin like consistency oily products making easier apply watery products id normally wary tends lead residue left skin slow absorption however dried almost immediately left zero residue no oily feeling no stickinessit also virtually scentless unless directly sniffing product bottle prefer scentless products big plus also sensitive skin notice zero redness itchiness using producti think may found new favorite toner fast absorption easy application scentless no residue no sensitivity issues,"['toners', 'ive', 'tried', 'similar', 'consistency', 'liquid', 'wet', 'like', 'water', 'one', 'seems', 'unique', 'applies', 'almost', 'oily', 'isnt', 'actually', 'oilyit', 'comes', 'tiny', 'droplets', 'applies', 'onto', 'skin', 'like', 'consistency', 'oily', 'products', 'making', 'easier', 'apply', 'watery', 'products', 'id', 'normally', 'wary', 'tends', 'lead', 'residue', 'left', 'skin', 'slow', 'absorption', 'however', 'dried', 'almost', 'immediately', 'left', 'zero', 'residue', 'no', 'oily', 'feeling', 'no', 'stickinessit', 'also', 'virtually', 'scentless', 'unless', 'directly', 'sniffing', 'product', 'bottle', 'prefer', 'scentless', 'products', 'big', 'plus', 'also', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'notice', 'zero', 'redness', 'itchiness', 'using', 'producti', 'think', 'may', 'found', 'new', 'favorite', 'toner', 'fast', 'absorption', 'easy', 'application', 'scentless', 'no', 'residue', 'no', 'sensitivity', 'issues']"
