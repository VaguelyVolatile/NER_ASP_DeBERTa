ive been using the roc retinol correxion line smoothing antiaging cream for a few months now and i have some mixed feelings about its effectiveness. i didnt really notice a difference at all. i would rather pay for something a little more expensive and know that it will work. i must note that the results have been more moderate than i had hoped for. while there has been some improvement it hasnt been as dramatic as i anticipated based on the product claims. its possible that my expectations were too high but i was hoping for a more noticeable difference in the appearance of fine lines.one drawback ive experienced is mild irritation. i followed the recommended usage instructions gradually introducing the product into my skincare routine but i still experienced some redness flakiness and sensitivity. its not unbearable but it does make me hesitant to use the cream as frequently as i would like.the packaging is simple and functional and i appreciate the hygienic pump dispenser. the cream itself has a lightweight texture and is easily absorbed which is a plus for daytime use under makeup.in terms of scent there is a faint chemical odor that dissipates quickly after application. its not overwhelming but its worth mentioning for those who are sensitive to scents.in conclusion the roc retinol correxion line smoothing antiaging cream has provided some improvement in my skins texture and fine lines albeit at a more moderate level. the mild irritation and the lessdramatic results are the main reasons for my 3star rating. while it may work better for others ill likely continue exploring other options for my antiaging skincare routine. moderate results mild irritation,ive using roc retinol correxion line smoothing antiaging cream months mixed feelings effectiveness . didnt really notice difference . would rather pay something little expensive know work . must note results moderate hoped . improvement hasnt dramatic anticipated based product claims . possible expectations high hoping noticeable difference appearance fine lines.one drawback ive experienced mild irritation . followed recommended usage instructions gradually introducing product skincare routine still experienced redness flakiness sensitivity . not unbearable make hesitant use cream frequently would like.the packaging simple functional appreciate hygienic pump dispenser . cream lightweight texture easily absorbed plus daytime use makeup.in terms scent faint chemical odor dissipates quickly application . not overwhelming worth mentioning sensitive scents.in conclusion roc retinol correxion line smoothing antiaging cream provided improvement skins texture fine lines albeit moderate level . mild irritation lessdramatic results main reasons 3star rating . may work better others ill likely continue exploring options antiaging skincare routine . moderate results mild irritation,"['ive', 'using', 'roc', 'retinol', 'correxion', 'line', 'smoothing', 'antiaging', 'cream', 'months', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'effectiveness', '.', 'didnt', 'really', 'notice', 'difference', '.', 'would', 'rather', 'pay', 'something', 'little', 'expensive', 'know', 'work', '.', 'must', 'note', 'results', 'moderate', 'hoped', '.', 'improvement', 'hasnt', 'dramatic', 'anticipated', 'based', 'product', 'claims', '.', 'possible', 'expectations', 'high', 'hoping', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'appearance', 'fine', 'lines.one', 'drawback', 'ive', 'experienced', 'mild', 'irritation', '.', 'followed', 'recommended', 'usage', 'instructions', 'gradually', 'introducing', 'product', 'skincare', 'routine', 'still', 'experienced', 'redness', 'flakiness', 'sensitivity', '.', 'not', 'unbearable', 'make', 'hesitant', 'use', 'cream', 'frequently', 'would', 'like.the', 'packaging', 'simple', 'functional', 'appreciate', 'hygienic', 'pump', 'dispenser', '.', 'cream', 'lightweight', 'texture', 'easily', 'absorbed', 'plus', 'daytime', 'use', 'makeup.in', 'terms', 'scent', 'faint', 'chemical', 'odor', 'dissipates', 'quickly', 'application', '.', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'sensitive', 'scents.in', 'conclusion', 'roc', 'retinol', 'correxion', 'line', 'smoothing', 'antiaging', 'cream', 'provided', 'improvement', 'skins', 'texture', 'fine', 'lines', 'albeit', 'moderate', 'level', '.', 'mild', 'irritation', 'lessdramatic', 'results', 'main', 'reasons', '3star', 'rating', '.', 'may', 'work', 'better', 'others', 'ill', 'likely', 'continue', 'exploring', 'options', 'antiaging', 'skincare', 'routine', '.', 'moderate', 'results', 'mild', 'irritation']"

i have been using this product 56 days a week fora little over a month now and i have noticed a softening in the lines around my eyes especially when i wear foundation andor powder i have a lot less creasing than i did before.  this product doesnt completely eliminate lines but they have improved more than with any other product i have tried so far.i use this product mainly at night instead of during the day because if i wear it under makeup my experience has been that my eyeshadow wears off a lot faster than if i just use an eyelid primer.  i have tried it under the makeup primer and had creasing and makeup fade.  this might be because i have pretty oily skin even on my eyelids.  those of you with dryer or more normal skin might have no problems at all with wearing this under makeup so definitely try it for yourself.still even though i cant use it as intended i do see results that for the price of the product i think are pretty impressive.  plus even after a month i still have about 23 of the tube left you dont need a lot of product at all.  in fact i recommend starting with the smallest dab you can put on your fingertip patting it in and then adding more if you need to.  i made the mistake early on of putting too much product on so that my skin wasnt able to absorb it all and about an hour later when i rubbed my eye i got a most unpleasant burning sensation. granted it doesnt last all that long but why waste product and get a burning eyeif youre looking for a good eye cream for a relatively low price this one is definitely worth trying. not a miracle product but i have noticed results,using product 56 days week fora little month noticed softening lines around eyes especially wear foundation andor powder lot less creasing . product doesnt completely eliminate lines improved product tried far.i use product mainly night instead day wear makeup experience eyeshadow wears lot faster use eyelid primer . tried makeup primer creasing makeup fade . might pretty oily skin even eyelids . dryer normal skin might no problems wearing makeup definitely try yourself.still even though cant use intended see results price product think pretty impressive . plus even month still 23 tube left dont need lot product . fact recommend starting smallest dab put fingertip patting adding need . made mistake early putting much product skin wasnt able absorb hour later rubbed eye got unpleasant burning sensation . granted doesnt last long waste product get burning eyeif youre looking good eye cream relatively low price one definitely worth trying . not miracle product noticed results,"['using', 'product', '56', 'days', 'week', 'fora', 'little', 'month', 'noticed', 'softening', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', 'especially', 'wear', 'foundation', 'andor', 'powder', 'lot', 'less', 'creasing', '.', 'product', 'doesnt', 'completely', 'eliminate', 'lines', 'improved', 'product', 'tried', 'far.i', 'use', 'product', 'mainly', 'night', 'instead', 'day', 'wear', 'makeup', 'experience', 'eyeshadow', 'wears', 'lot', 'faster', 'use', 'eyelid', 'primer', '.', 'tried', 'makeup', 'primer', 'creasing', 'makeup', 'fade', '.', 'might', 'pretty', 'oily', 'skin', 'even', 'eyelids', '.', 'dryer', 'normal', 'skin', 'might', 'no', 'problems', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'definitely', 'try', 'yourself.still', 'even', 'though', 'cant', 'use', 'intended', 'see', 'results', 'price', 'product', 'think', 'pretty', 'impressive', '.', 'plus', 'even', 'month', 'still', '23', 'tube', 'left', 'dont', 'need', 'lot', 'product', '.', 'fact', 'recommend', 'starting', 'smallest', 'dab', 'put', 'fingertip', 'patting', 'adding', 'need', '.', 'made', 'mistake', 'early', 'putting', 'much', 'product', 'skin', 'wasnt', 'able', 'absorb', 'hour', 'later', 'rubbed', 'eye', 'got', 'unpleasant', 'burning', 'sensation', '.', 'granted', 'doesnt', 'last', 'long', 'waste', 'product', 'get', 'burning', 'eyeif', 'youre', 'looking', 'good', 'eye', 'cream', 'relatively', 'low', 'price', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'trying', '.', 'not', 'miracle', 'product', 'noticed', 'results']"

i am 33 had a baby right before i turned 31 prior to that i had cystic type acne all my life that i never grew out of then got acne in places i never had it before when i was pregnant and lets face it growing a baby does stuff to your body some stuff you never come back from and i stayed pretty hormonally imbalanced for a long time. im very fair skinned and every pimple popped or unpopped left a lasting pink scar on my face requiring concealer months long after its official departure. a reminder of the pimple that had beenhad almost been that needed to be hidden as more approached. id used the classic proactiv with the best results for years and years and went right back to that with the same results of its not 100 but its better than everything else. and on top of it i have always had an incredibly oily face and scalp. my mother first suggested something with hyaluronic acid and that was becoming increasingly popular while i was pregnant and was not supposed to use it so i didnt give it another thought. but with my boy about to be turning 2 and my skin still so confused i figured id give it a shot. i read outstanding reviews of this stuff and figured id give it a shot. i got the serum and the hyaluronic acid moisturizer and got the regular face cream and eye cream in case my skin got dry. i just read a bunch of people talking about how the first week or two you use it it can cause dryness and some peeling so i figured i should have some of the basic stuff too. i dont know if its just that my skin was used to the harshness of benzoyl peroxide on the regular or that im so greasy but i didnt experience any of the dryness redness or irritation that a lot of people report the first couple weeks. and i really went balls to the wall with this and cut the proactiv out completely. scary prospect for me. but no joke just using the serum and the hyaluronic acid moisturizer every day within a few days my skin calmed down a massive amount. the moisturizer is a little on the heavy side although i used it pretty liberally and is a little heavy for use under makeup if youre heavy handed like me but id still put some on let it soak in awhile and just wipe my face down real quick with a cleansing cloth and it was all good. by the end of the first week id had no new pimples and noticed dramatic lightening in the marks from old pimples along with a generally more even skin tone and my face felt smoother softer calmer and looked it too. i have not turned back. the best part is that my skin is also not as greasy as it was before and i have finally found a moisturizer that doesnt make me break out worse. and my skin just soaks up that serum and that stuff is amazing. all these products are amazing,33 baby right turned 31 prior cystic type acne life never grew got

i am very pleased with this plumping eye cream. i like the natural ingredients and can feel confident using all the products in eight saints skin care line.i am a huge fan of the applicator tip that is metal and helps the cream smooth on like butter. the cream itself is lightweight non greasy and has a very faint natural smell. it absorbs quickly which i like so i dont have to wait very long to apply moisturizer or oil on top.to test the effectiveness i applied this on one eye and maintained my normal routine with a brightening under eye cream on the other side for a week.  it took about the whole week for me to notice a difference but i can definitely tell my eye is less puffy and just looks more fresh on the side using this plumping cream. i think this is an easy switch and will become a staple in my skincare routine. ,pleased plumping eye cream . like natural ingredients feel confident using products eight saints skin care line.i huge fan applicator tip metal helps cream smooth like butter . cream lightweight non greasy faint natural smell . absorbs quickly like dont wait long apply moisturizer oil top.to test effectiveness applied one eye maintained normal routine brightening eye cream side week . took whole week notice difference definitely tell eye less puffy looks fresh side using plumping cream . think easy switch become staple skincare routine .,"['pleased', 'plumping', 'eye', 'cream', '.', 'like', 'natural', 'ingredients', 'feel', 'confident', 'using', 'products', 'eight', 'saints', 'skin', 'care', 'line.i', 'huge', 'fan', 'applicator', 'tip', 'metal', 'helps', 'cream', 'smooth', 'like', 'butter', '.', 'cream', 'lightweight', 'non', 'greasy', 'faint', 'natural', 'smell', '.', 'absorbs', 'quickly', 'like', 'dont', 'wait', 'long', 'apply', 'moisturizer', 'oil', 'top.to', 'test', 'effectiveness', 'applied', 'one', 'eye', 'maintained', 'normal', 'routine', 'brightening', 'eye', 'cream', 'side', 'week', '.', 'took', 'whole', 'week', 'notice', 'difference', 'definitely', 'tell', 'eye', 'less', 'puffy', 'looks', 'fresh', 'side', 'using', 'plumping', 'cream', '.', 'think', 'easy', 'switch', 'become', 'staple', 'skincare', 'routine', '.']"

if a picture is worth a 1000 words then 5 photos will be worth a book.  the cream was delivered this afternoon.  i immediately tried it.  i never expected this result.i knew the cream was out for delivery so i didnt put makeup on today.  all you see is my clean face which i washed 4 hours ago.  ive not applied anything no creams no serums nothing.  im 63 about to turn 64 in 3 weeks.  i dont use retinol and although i probably should be using a lightweight cream at night i dont.  my face is still pretty oily and i have oily eyelids.all photos are taken in natural light in the living room with just light coming in the windows.  i didnt use the camera flash.  with the exception of the final photo i even sat in the same chair.  i tried to crop the photos the same and even tried to look in the same direction.  i tried to make the photo comparison as close exact as i could.the last photo was taken upstairs in the dressing room no artificial light with the window facing the same exposure as the living room windows.  the room is brighter because there is no porch.ive never even heard of 8 saints.  ive been looking for a peptide cream for my undereyes to wear under makeup.  ive tried several some expensive others drug store brands but ive found nothing that was extraordinary until i tried thus cream today.  its blown me away.i ordered the cream because of photos i saw in these reviews.  i never ever expected to see results like this immediately.  i saw a couple of reviews were the folks showed differences after 10 minutes or so.  most reviews were more like a week which is impressivethe photos eventually span an hour.  the first set with the cream under 1 eye were taken 6 minutes apart.  after i saw the results i put it under my other eye then finally on my eyelids.  finally i put it on the 11 worry lines between my eyebrows which are very deep.  i couldnt believe the difference in just a few minutes.i wanted to make sure that the results werent just from sudden hydration.  most of the time you can hydrate and fine lines will disappear only to return after a half hour or so after the cream has completely absorbed.  thats why i took the final photo where the room was a bit brighter to show everything but not so bright as to wash out any features.the photo speaks for itself.  ive started a small photographic file.  im going to continue to take a photograph daily in the same room at the same time per day so we all can see how 8 saints performs over a longer period.im extremely thrilled with this product.  i hope they never change the formula

i bought this after seeing other caffeine eye serums but this one was appealing because of the roller ball. i have to say it feels awesome the roller ball is nice and cold which feels really relaxing and refreshing and it rolls really well  doesnt get glopped up with product or stuck. i also like that serum doesnt feel oily or sticky during or after application or throughout the day. its actually helped with my eyelids feeling less oily by the end of the day. my undereye and eyelid areas do feel tighter and less puffy with use and  particularly in natural light  i feel like my dark circles are less prominent. for me its a mix of this product being a cooling and refreshing way to wake up in the morning that feels really good like a spa day or part of a selfcare routine i look forward to doing each morning and looking and feeling less puffy and tired. i also feel like you get a good amount of product for the money and the packaging is really nice. i sort of bought this on a whim during a time when i was feeling particularly tired and drained and like my eyes were definitely reflecting that and looking dark and extra puffy and droopy and this product was much better than i expected it to be in every way. i plan to buy this again when it runs out. ,bought seeing caffeine eye serums one appealing roller ball . say feels awesome roller ball nice cold feels really relaxing refreshing rolls really well doesnt get glopped product stuck . also like serum doesnt feel oily sticky application throughout day . actually helped eyelids feeling less oily end day . undereye eyelid areas feel tighter less puffy use particularly natural light feel like dark circles less prominent . mix product cooling refreshing way wake morning feels really good like spa day part selfcare routine look forward morning looking feeling less puffy tired . also feel like get good amount product money packaging really nice . sort bought whim time feeling particularly tired drained like eyes definitely reflecting looking dark extra puffy droopy product much better expected every way . plan buy runs .,"['bought', 'seeing', 'caffeine', 'eye', 'serums', 'one', 'appealing', 'roller', 'ball', '.', 'say', 'feels', 'awesome', 'roller', 'ball', 'nice', 'cold', 'feels', 'really', 'relaxing', 'refreshing', 'rolls', 'really', 'well', 'doesnt', 'get', 'glopped', 'product', 'stuck', '.', 'also', 'like', 'serum', 'doesnt', 'feel', 'oily', 'sticky', 'application', 'throughout', 'day', '.', 'actually', 'helped', 'eyelids', 'feeling', 'less', 'oily', 'end', 'day', '.', 'undereye', 'eyelid', 'areas', 'feel', 'tighter', 'less', 'puffy', 'use', 'particularly', 'natural', 'light', 'feel', 'like', 'dark', 'circles', 'less', 'prominent', '.', 'mix', 'product', 'cooling', 'refreshing', 'way', 'wake', 'morning', 'feels', 'really', 'good', 'like', 'spa', 'day', 'part', 'selfcare', 'routine', 'look', 'forward', 'morning', 'looking', 'feeling', 'less', 'puffy', 'tired', '.', 'also', 'feel', 'like', 'get', 'good', 'amount', 'product', 'money', 'packaging', 'really', 'nice', '.', 'sort', 'bought', 'whim', 'time', 'feeling', 'particularly', 'tired', 'drained', 'like', 'eyes', 'definitely', 'reflecting', 'looking', 'dark', 'extra', 'puffy', 'droopy', 'product', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'every', 'way', '.', 'plan', 'buy', 'runs', '.']"

im a skeptic and rarely believe hype. but you can see the improvement after a short time. and still obvious after 2 hours. it does just stretch your skin and creates a tight sensation under your eye. actually any improvement to this old mans face is good.i read many of the reviews and gleened information before i decided to try this product. i am use to the stock negative reviews. and seem to expect the usual number of nay sayers. but it also had visual results. so i bought some.first no the bottle isnt empty. you have to clear the hole out by scrapping your fingernail over the hole to remove hardened cream. then it works. do you actually think they would send you an empty bottleif you look at the after picture one eye looks better than the other. i think it was because applying it to the better eye i just made one smooth stroke compared to the other eye. the other eye i rubbed the product in a couple times accentually thinning the application. but i had to try this in public and see if it was worth the cost. i think it was and will certainly use it for a wedding we are attending in a month.nothing is perfect but this solution is worth the cost for a drastic improvement. its not for everyone but it beats surgery ,im skeptic rarely believe hype . see improvement short time . still obvious 2 hours . stretch skin creates tight sensation eye . actually improvement old mans face good.i read many reviews gleened information decided try product . use stock negative reviews . seem expect usual number nay sayers . also visual results . bought some.first no bottle isnt empty . clear hole scrapping fingernail hole remove hardened cream . works . actually think would send empty bottleif look picture one eye looks better . think applying better eye made one smooth stroke compared eye . eye rubbed product couple times accentually thinning application . try public see worth cost . think certainly use wedding attending month.nothing perfect solution worth cost drastic improvement . not everyone beats surgery,"['im', 'skeptic', 'rarely', 'believe', 'hype', '.', 'see', 'improvement', 'short', 'time', '.', 'still', 'obvious', '2', 'hours', '.', 'stretch', 'skin', 'creates', 'tight', 'sensation', 'eye', '.', 'actually', 'improvement', 'old', 'mans', 'face', 'good.i', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'gleened', 'information', 'decided', 'try', 'product', '.', 'use', 'stock', 'negative', 'reviews', '.', 'seem', 'expect', 'usual', 'number', 'nay', 'sayers', '.', 'also', 'visual', 'results', '.', 'bought', 'some.first', 'no', 'bottle', 'isnt', 'empty', '.', 'clear', 'hole', 'scrapping', 'fingernail', 'hole', 'remove', 'hardened', 'cream', '.', 'works', '.', 'actually', 'think', 'would', 'send', 'empty', 'bottleif', 'look', 'picture', 'one', 'eye', 'looks', 'better', '.', 'think', 'applying', 'better', 'eye', 'made', 'one', 'smooth', 'stroke', 'compared', 'eye', '.', 'eye', 'rubbed', 'product', 'couple', 'times', 'accentually', 'thinning', 'application', '.', 'try', 'public', 'see', 'worth', 'cost', '.', 'think', 'certainly', 'use', 'wedding', 'attending', 'month.nothing', 'perfect', 'solution', 'worth', 'cost', 'drastic', 'improvement', '.', 'not', 'everyone', 'beats', 'surgery']"

update 10924ive been using it for around 5 weeks and i see a positive difference. puffiness especially right after waking up goes down considerably after putting it on. i get terrible dark circles under my eyes and after using it consistently they are much better. i think this is one of the most effective products i have ever used for my undereyes.tips for applyingthe first time i used it i went to town with the rollerball on my undereyes. i pumped with the rollerball directly onto my skin. the pump lets out a lot of product on one squeeze.then there was left over serum on my face so i took it and rubbed a very thin layer onto my eyelids with my finger since it felt so nice.this resulted in a small bit of the product running into the top of my eye. plus the excess from the rollerball backed up into the bottom of my eyes.big mistakesmy eyes were very blurry. id tear up and try and wipe my eyes and the blurry would keep coming back for awhile which of course freaked me out.here is my new way of applying the product pump the bottle 12 or 14 pump onto a cotton swab q tip use the cotton swab to rub a small amount under your eyes but closer to the top of your cheekbones if you have crows feet be extra careful to keep the serum from getting in the outer corners of your eyes do not put on eyelids to avoid having even a little bit of it drip into your eyes as it is a thin runny serumi think it works well although i have not had it long. i like the mix of active ingredients it has. there is a lot of good stuff in here. its an excellent value. before i bought this i had just returned a similar product with an eye rollerball that was over three times the price.in conclusion i think i will keep it and keep using it. i recommend trying it. very effective. i highly recommend it,update 10924ive using around 5 weeks see positive difference . puffiness especially right waking goes considerably putting . get terrible dark circles eyes using consistently much better . think one effective products ever used undereyes.tips applyingthe first time used went town rollerball undereyes . pumped rollerball directly onto skin . pump lets lot product one squeeze.then left serum face took rubbed thin layer onto eyelids finger since felt nice.this resulted small bit product running top eye . plus excess rollerball backed bottom eyes.big mistakesmy eyes blurry . id tear try wipe eyes blurry would keep coming back awhile course freaked out.here new way applying product pump bottle 12 14 pump onto cotton swab q tip use cotton swab rub small amount eyes closer top cheekbones crows feet extra careful keep serum getting outer corners eyes not put eyelids avoid even little bit drip eyes thin runny serumi think works well although not long . like mix active ingredients . lot good stuff . excellent value . bought returned similar product eye rollerball three times price.in conclusion think keep keep using . recommend trying . effective . highly recommend,"['update', '10924ive', 'using', 'around', '5', 'weeks', 'see', 'positive', 'difference', '.', 'puffiness', 'especially', 'right', 'waking', 'goes', 'considerably', 'putting', '.', 'get', 'terrible', 'dark', 'circles', 'eyes', 'using', 'consistently', 'much', 'better', '.', 'think', 'one', 'effective', 'products', 'ever', 'used', 'undereyes.tips', 'applyingthe', 'first', 'time', 'used', 'went', 'town', 'rollerball', 'undereyes', '.', 'pumped', 'rollerball', 'directly', 'onto', 'skin', '.', 'pump', 'lets', 'lot', 'product', 'one', 'squeeze.then', 'left', 'serum', 'face', 'took', 'rubbed', 'thin', 'layer', 'onto', 'eyelids', 'finger', 'since', 'felt', 'nice.this', 'resulted', 'small', 'bit', 'product', 'running', 'top', 'eye', '.', 'plus', 'excess', 'rollerball', 'backed', 'bottom', 'eyes.big', 'mistakesmy', 'eyes', 'blurry', '.', 'id', 'tear', 'try', 'wipe', 'eyes', 'blurry', 'would', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'awhile', 'course', 'freaked', 'out.here', 'new', 'way', 'applying', 'product', 'pump', 'bottle', '12', '14', 'pump', 'onto', 'cotton', 'swab', 'q', 'tip', 'use', 'cotton', 'swab', 'rub', 'small', 'amount', 'eyes', 'closer', 'top', 'cheekbones', 'crows', 'feet', 'extra', 'careful', 'keep', 'serum', 'getting', 'outer', 'corners', 'eyes', 'not', 'put', 'eyelids', 'avoid', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'drip', 'eyes', 'thin', 'runny', 'serumi', 'think', 'works', 'well', 'although', 'not', 'long', '.', 'like', 'mix', 'active', 'ingredients', '.', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', '.', 'excellent', 'value', '.', 'bought', 'returned', 'similar', 'product', 'eye', 'rollerball', 'three', 'times', 'price.in', 'conclusion', 'think', 'keep', 'keep', 'using', '.', 'recommend', 'trying', '.', 'effective', '.', 'highly', 'recommend']"

you absolutely see an immediate visible tightening. however what i soon after learned is that it just seems to be behaving as a cover that temporarily tightens versus something that actually improves your skin. but what really did it for me and why i am rating it low is because i was sitting at my desk about 2 hours after and i had an itch on my eye. after i moved the skin where ever i had put the serum turned immediately into a white cracked web. so just out of curiosity as i stood in front of the mirror i gently touched the skin near the outside corner of my other key and sure enough it did the same thing instantly. once it dries if you move our touch the skin in any way it literally turns white and cracked everywhere you put the serum. no thank you. luckily i was at home and could wash it off. but what if i had been in front of someone and needed to itch my eye. sorry not what i was looking for. so if you are looking for a temporary facade of tigher skin and you will never have any movement to your skin in that area go for it. it will look good. but if you are human and have any amount of movement on your face beware. i wish i would return it for a refund and get my 20 back but since i used it that one time i dont think i am eligible. just a wasted 20. i was so hopeful but am so diappointed,absolutely see immediate visible tightening . however soon learned seems behaving cover temporarily tightens versus something actually improves skin . really rating low sitting desk 2 hours itch eye . moved skin ever put serum turned immediately white cracked web . curiosity stood front mirror gently touched skin near outside corner key sure enough thing instantly . dries move touch skin way literally turns white cracked everywhere put serum . no thank . luckily home could wash . front someone needed itch eye . sorry not looking . looking temporary facade tigher skin never movement skin area go . look good . human amount movement face beware . wish would return refund get 20 back since used one time dont think eligible . wasted 20. hopeful diappointed,"['absolutely', 'see', 'immediate', 'visible', 'tightening', '.', 'however', 'soon', 'learned', 'seems', 'behaving', 'cover', 'temporarily', 'tightens', 'versus', 'something', 'actually', 'improves', 'skin', '.', 'really', 'rating', 'low', 'sitting', 'desk', '2', 'hours', 'itch', 'eye', '.', 'moved', 'skin', 'ever', 'put', 'serum', 'turned', 'immediately', 'white', 'cracked', 'web', '.', 'curiosity', 'stood', 'front', 'mirror', 'gently', 'touched', 'skin', 'near', 'outside', 'corner', 'key', 'sure', 'enough', 'thing', 'instantly', '.', 'dries', 'move', 'touch', 'skin', 'way', 'literally', 'turns', 'white', 'cracked', 'everywhere', 'put', 'serum', '.', 'no', 'thank', '.', 'luckily', 'home', 'could', 'wash', '.', 'front', 'someone', 'needed', 'itch', 'eye', '.', 'sorry', 'not', 'looking', '.', 'looking', 'temporary', 'facade', 'tigher', 'skin', 'never', 'movement', 'skin', 'area', 'go', '.', 'look', 'good', '.', 'human', 'amount', 'movement', 'face', 'beware', '.', 'wish', 'would', 'return', 'refund', 'get', '20', 'back', 'since', 'used', 'one', 'time', 'dont', 'think', 'eligible', '.', 'wasted', '20.', 'hopeful', 'diappointed']"

i have always struggled with under eye bags i think its genetic honestly and so i finally decided to buy a product to help lighten them. while my bags have not magically disappeared wasnt expecting them to since i was practically born with them haha the caffeine in the serum really wakes me up and makes my eyes look and feel bright and alive and less puffy. the serum is very moisturizing and i do notice a slight difference in how pronounced my under eye bags are. i am not worrying about wrinkles at the moment since im only 20 and quite frankly think its cute when people have the little wrinkles by the corner of their eyes but i can also see this having the potential to proactively prevent wrinkles. moisturizing is always good for the skin and this serum definitely helps with that i also love the little pump design the bottle has. you just push it on the back of your hand and then use the roller to spread it under your eyes. love this product and would recommendp.s. i have pretty sensitive skin and i dont seem to notice any irritation with this product so gotta love that ,always struggled eye bags think genetic honestly finally decided buy product help lighten . bags not magically disappeared wasnt expecting since practically born haha caffeine serum really wakes makes eyes look feel bright alive less puffy . serum moisturizing notice slight difference pronounced eye bags . not worrying wrinkles moment since im 20 quite frankly think cute people little wrinkles corner eyes also see potential proactively prevent wrinkles . moisturizing always good skin serum definitely helps also love little pump design bottle . push back hand use roller spread eyes . love product would recommendp.s . pretty sensitive skin dont seem notice irritation product got ta love,"['always', 'struggled', 'eye', 'bags', 'think', 'genetic', 'honestly', 'finally', 'decided', 'buy', 'product', 'help', 'lighten', '.', 'bags', 'not', 'magically', 'disappeared', 'wasnt', 'expecting', 'since', 'practically', 'born', 'haha', 'caffeine', 'serum', 'really', 'wakes', 'makes', 'eyes', 'look', 'feel', 'bright', 'alive', 'less', 'puffy', '.', 'serum', 'moisturizing', 'notice', 'slight', 'difference', 'pronounced', 'eye', 'bags', '.', 'not', 'worrying', 'wrinkles', 'moment', 'since', 'im', '20', 'quite', 'frankly', 'think', 'cute', 'people', 'little', 'wrinkles', 'corner', 'eyes', 'also', 'see', 'potential', 'proactively', 'prevent', 'wrinkles', '.', 'moisturizing', 'always', 'good', 'skin', 'serum', 'definitely', 'helps', 'also', 'love', 'little', 'pump', 'design', 'bottle', '.', 'push', 'back', 'hand', 'use', 'roller', 'spread', 'eyes', '.', 'love', 'product', 'would', 'recommendp.s', '.', 'pretty', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'dont', 'seem', 'notice', 'irritation', 'product', 'got', 'ta', 'love']"

i like the packaging on this product it has a square light acrylicplastic jar which is attractive and easy to use. for an eye cream product the product amount is quite large at half an ounce. the cream itself is white with a bit of a smellbut it only seems to be very lightly fragranced and i can really only smell it right as i put it on. then it smells a bit floral but i dont notice it after the product absorbs. the product does absorb well and it leaves my skin feeling supple for hours .this cream is supposed to be and overall eye rejuvenator including the lashes. i have not found it to be any sudden miracle for my lashes but after a weeks use i do think my lashes are not falling out as much as they were. the first couple of days that i use this product i had some light itching around my eyelashes and i noticed a few came out. i had nearly decided to stop using it but it wasnt so bad that i felt the product was faulty. after a couple of days i did not experience any itch or strange feeling at all during application. it just became very pleasant to use.  i had kept using it because i thought perhaps that cell growth was just perhaps sped up. so after another week i noticed that my lashes had stopped falling out as often as they normally did. i have not noticed any extra growth but the product is certainly easy to use now all over my eye and so i will continue. it is certainly much easier and more pleasant to use this than those eyelash serums that go on with a mascara applicator.this product is definitely good for under eye crepe. well i cant say that ive had any major line reduction it does a great job of moisturizing and keeping my undereye area from looking dry and crepey. i have not noticed any improvement whatsoever in the natural darkness that i have under my eyes.well i do like the packaging i have some concern about the hygiene of putting my fingers in a jar of product that i am using at my lash line. i think that this would be better with a pump dispenser i know i certainly would feel better about it. so while i like the packaging from an aesthetic standpoint i think that from a hygienic perspective a pump would be better. pleasant to

i havent noticed any of the results other reviewers have claimed so id overall say this is a pretty midtier eye cream that could be had at a more affordable point. personally the dark under my eyes is from a chronic lack of sleep so nothing really helps with those so your mileage may vary on that point. it is nice to put on and does make my skin feel soft at least. ,havent noticed results reviewers claimed id overall say pretty midtier eye cream could affordable point . personally dark eyes chronic lack sleep nothing really helps mileage may vary point . nice put make skin feel soft least .,"['havent', 'noticed', 'results', 'reviewers', 'claimed', 'id', 'overall', 'say', 'pretty', 'midtier', 'eye', 'cream', 'could', 'affordable', 'point', '.', 'personally', 'dark', 'eyes', 'chronic', 'lack', 'sleep', 'nothing', 'really', 'helps', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'point', '.', 'nice', 'put', 'make', 'skin', 'feel', 'soft', 'least', '.']"

ive been searching for something to take care of the dark circles and bagslines under my eyes for a few years. recently my dermatologist said all i needed was a product with caffeine and a moisturizer combined. i found this product and liked the reviews. when i received it i took it straight out of the box to give it a try.pros the metal eyeroller to apply the serum provides a nice cool touch that feels really nice on the skin. this also ensures that you are applying the product to the skin evenly until the skin absorbs it. the roller does not reabsorb the product like a sponge. products that require you to use your fingers for application causes you to add your own oils and absorb into the fingers with a waste of the product. i didnt see immediate results but my skin looked fuller throughout the day. i was able to apply this under my makeup. just wait for the serum to dry first. no residue or fragrances. i have sensitive skin so no irritation was a plus.cons the rollerball of the applicator has to be pushed in slightly to allow the serum to be released to use. however you dont want to press the applicator to your skin to get the release because that hurts. so i used the back of my hand. after a few tries i figured out how much pressure was enough to get the serum to flow. this was my only complaint.fyi my husband is starting to use it as well. for the price and result this is a great product. ,ive searching something take care dark circles bagslines eyes years . recently dermatologist said needed product caffeine moisturizer combined . found product liked reviews . received took straight box give try.pros metal eyeroller apply serum provides nice cool touch feels really nice skin . also ensures applying product skin evenly skin absorbs . roller not reabsorb product like sponge . products require use fingers application causes add oils absorb fingers waste product . didnt see immediate results skin looked fuller throughout day . able apply makeup . wait serum dry first . no residue fragrances . sensitive skin no irritation plus.cons rollerball applicator pushed slightly allow serum released use . however dont want press applicator skin get release hurts . used back hand . tries figured much pressure enough get serum flow . complaint.fyi husband starting use well . price result great product .,"['ive', 'searching', 'something', 'take', 'care', 'dark', 'circles', 'bagslines', 'eyes', 'years', '.', 'recently', 'dermatologist', 'said', 'needed', 'product', 'caffeine', 'moisturizer', 'combined', '.', 'found', 'product', 'liked', 'reviews', '.', 'received', 'took', 'straight', 'box', 'give', 'try.pros', 'metal', 'eyeroller', 'apply', 'serum', 'provides', 'nice', 'cool', 'touch', 'feels', 'really', 'nice', 'skin', '.', 'also', 'ensures', 'applying', 'product', 'skin', 'evenly', 'skin', 'absorbs', '.', 'roller', 'not', 'reabsorb', 'product', 'like', 'sponge', '.', 'products', 'require', 'use', 'fingers', 'application', 'causes', 'add', 'oils', 'absorb', 'fingers', 'waste', 'product', '.', 'didnt', 'see', 'immediate', 'results', 'skin', 'looked', 'fuller', 'throughout', 'day', '.', 'able', 'apply', 'makeup', '.', 'wait', 'serum', 'dry', 'first', '.', 'no', 'residue', 'fragrances', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'no', 'irritation', 'plus.cons', 'rollerball', 'applicator', 'pushed', 'slightly', 'allow', 'serum', 'released', 'use', '.', 'however', 'dont', 'want', 'press', 'applicator', 'skin', 'get', 'release', 'hurts', '.', 'used', 'back', 'hand', '.', 'tries', 'figured', 'much', 'pressure', 'enough', 'get', 'serum', 'flow', '.', 'complaint.fyi', 'husband', 'starting', 'use', 'well', '.', 'price', 'result', 'great', 'product', '.']"

i wanted to love this eye treatment. the applicator design is fabulous no issues or concerns with the pump. the roller ball makes an ideal applicator and is lovely cool to the touch.and the product itself works very well in most not all regards. it definitely helps with dreaded eye bags with a solid skin tightening effect. it appeared to really help with the dark circles under my eyes with regular use.the reason its not a 5 star product for me is that the same great skin tightening effect appears to emphasize the fine lines around my eyes. im 61 and have a good network of those going.the other eye treatment i use is equally good maybe better at eliminating dark circles not quite as effective at reducing under eye bagginess. but its more moisturizing and  completely plumps out the fine lines around my eyes.for now im following this product with my other eye serum but much as i adore the design this wont be a repeat purchase for me. if youre young without any fine eye lines to speak of and oily or normal skin i could see this becoming your holy grail eye goto though. very good not perfect for older skin,wanted love eye treatment . applicator design fabulous no issues concerns pump . roller ball makes ideal applicator lovely cool touch.and product works well not regards . definitely helps dreaded eye bags solid skin tightening effect . appeared really help dark circles eyes regular use.the reason not 5 star product great skin tightening effect appears emphasize fine lines around eyes . im 61 good network going.the eye treatment use equally good maybe better eliminating dark circles not quite effective reducing eye bagginess . moisturizing completely plumps fine lines around eyes.for im following product eye serum much adore design wont repeat purchase . youre young without fine eye lines speak oily normal skin could see becoming holy grail eye goto though . good not perfect older skin,"['wanted', 'love', 'eye', 'treatment', '.', 'applicator', 'design', 'fabulous', 'no', 'issues', 'concerns', 'pump', '.', 'roller', 'ball', 'makes', 'ideal', 'applicator', 'lovely', 'cool', 'touch.and', 'product', 'works', 'well', 'not', 'regards', '.', 'definitely', 'helps', 'dreaded', 'eye', 'bags', 'solid', 'skin', 'tightening', 'effect', '.', 'appeared', 'really', 'help', 'dark', 'circles', 'eyes', 'regular', 'use.the', 'reason', 'not', '5', 'star', 'product', 'great', 'skin', 'tightening', 'effect', 'appears', 'emphasize', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', '.', 'im', '61', 'good', 'network', 'going.the', 'eye', 'treatment', 'use', 'equally', 'good', 'maybe', 'better', 'eliminating', 'dark', 'circles', 'not', 'quite', 'effective', 'reducing', 'eye', 'bagginess', '.', 'moisturizing', 'completely', 'plumps', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes.for', 'im', 'following', 'product', 'eye', 'serum', 'much', 'adore', 'design', 'wont', 'repeat', 'purchase', '.', 'youre', 'young', 'without', 'fine', 'eye', 'lines', 'speak', 'oily', 'normal', 'skin', 'could', 'see', 'becoming', 'holy', 'grail', 'eye', 'goto', 'though', '.', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'older', 'skin']"

i am 77 years old and have had eye bags for as long as i can remember. i have tried quite a few different products that were suppose to reduce bags under the eyes and none of them have even improved the condition. actually my problem has been twofold. there is a swelling under each eye and then a literal bag under this. the bags under the swelling are sometimes reddened and almost look like they are filled with fluid.having read the numerous positive reviews on this product i decided to try it and honestly expected no miracles. i have been using this product twice a day for about 2 weeks. although i dont see much difference in the swelling directly under my eyes the eye bags have been greatly reduced an no longer look like they are filled with fluid. granted they arent gone but i have had them for a very long time and as i said didnt expect miracles.i will continue to use this product in hopes the bags will eventually go away completely. since i dont have wrinkles to speak of the elimination of the eye bags would greatly improve my appearance. you may wonder why i bother at my age but i feel the way you look helps to improve selfesteem. it you look better you feel better. besides how many of us like to hear that we dont look our age.update 122523i have been using this product for about 5 weeks twice a day and have added before and after pictures. although i dont think the bags are completely gone they are so much smaller and less reddened than before i started using this product. i am hoping the bags will go away completely eventually but they are so much better now than they had been.update 040724at this point i have been using this product religiously for about 4 months. although there was some improvement and my eyebags go smaller the first couple of months. i havent seem much improvement in the last month or so. i guess nothing works miracles but this product did help to reduce the size of my eyebags. i plan to continue using the product for a couple more months to see if the last bit of bags just takes a little longer. after that if there is no further improvement i will likely discontinue using this product.i hope this review was helpful for you. after 2 weeks of  use seems to be working.,77 years old eye bags long remember . tried quite different products suppose reduce bags eyes none even improved condition . actually problem

i was really excited to see try this after id seen it on facebook so i followed the instructions and put the product on. firstly you do feel a tightening under the eye but i think this sensation is due to the product drying which gives the sensation of tightening. looking in the mirror i can see a very very slight difference but im still not convinced its actually depuffing i think it probably is the tinted product drying on the skin.also the claim that it goes on and wont cake or leave a residue is completely false. i would have to replace my under eye concealer with this product because you can visibly see it sitting on the skin and its cakey. if i tried to put a color correction concealer over the top it would get chunky. so its definitely not a product that absorbs. it seems to sit on top of the skin and looks like tinted concealer. thats probably a big no for me because the last thing you need is heavy layer of product sitting on your under eyes.so what is possibly a tiny bit of tightening in a very tiny tube  at a high price point i just dont think its worth it. im not convinced its worth the price,really excited see try id seen facebook followed instructions put product . firstly feel tightening eye think sensation due product drying gives sensation tightening . looking mirror see slight difference im still not convinced actually depuffing think probably tinted product drying skin.also claim goes wont cake leave residue completely false . would replace eye concealer product visibly see sitting skin cakey . tried put color correction concealer top would get chunky . definitely not product absorbs . seems sit top skin looks like tinted concealer . thats probably big no last thing need heavy layer product sitting eyes.so possibly tiny bit tightening tiny tube high price point dont think worth . im not convinced worth price,"['really', 'excited', 'see', 'try', 'id', 'seen', 'facebook', 'followed', 'instructions', 'put', 'product', '.', 'firstly', 'feel', 'tightening', 'eye', 'think', 'sensation', 'due', 'product', 'drying', 'gives', 'sensation', 'tightening', '.', 'looking', 'mirror', 'see', 'slight', 'difference', 'im', 'still', 'not', 'convinced', 'actually', 'depuffing', 'think', 'probably', 'tinted', 'product', 'drying', 'skin.also', 'claim', 'goes', 'wont', 'cake', 'leave', 'residue', 'completely', 'false', '.', 'would', 'replace', 'eye', 'concealer', 'product', 'visibly', 'see', 'sitting', 'skin', 'cakey', '.', 'tried', 'put', 'color', 'correction', 'concealer', 'top', 'would', 'get', 'chunky', '.', 'definitely', 'not', 'product', 'absorbs', '.', 'seems', 'sit', 'top', 'skin', 'looks', 'like', 'tinted', 'concealer', '.', 'thats', 'probably', 'big', 'no', 'last', 'thing', 'need', 'heavy', 'layer', 'product', 'sitting', 'eyes.so', 'possibly', 'tiny', 'bit', 'tightening', 'tiny', 'tube', 'high', 'price', 'point', 'dont', 'think', 'worth', '.', 'im', 'not', 'convinced', 'worth', 'price']"

this is the single most transformative skin care product i have ever used and ive used it all simply apply a generous layer to clean dry skin and pat it in. i layer it with translucent spf powder. it lasts the entire day long to camouflage the melted candle sagging look of aging under eyes and there is a very subtle color correction that makes dark circles magically unnoticeable. i dont know what type of technology this product utilizes but it goes away once you wash it off. im not sure if it has any longterm benefits but who cares what it does is so incredible and completely undetectable on skin unlike concealing makeup products which can get cakey settle into lines and are totally obvious. this little tube lasts forever too if youre not happy with the way its going on youre probably not using enough or youre using too much and youre not putting it on clean dry skin or youre putting something on over it. try using it as described above and trust me you will see the difference. ,single transformative skin care product ever used ive used simply apply generous layer clean dry skin pat . layer translucent spf powder . lasts entire day long camouflage melted candle sagging look aging eyes subtle color correction makes dark circles magically unnoticeable . dont know type technology product utilizes goes away wash . im not sure longterm benefits cares incredible completely undetectable skin unlike concealing makeup products get cakey settle lines totally obvious . little tube lasts forever youre not happy way going youre probably not using enough youre using much youre not putting clean dry skin youre putting something . try using described trust see difference .,"['single', 'transformative', 'skin', 'care', 'product', 'ever', 'used', 'ive', 'used', 'simply', 'apply', 'generous', 'layer', 'clean', 'dry', 'skin', 'pat', '.', 'layer', 'translucent', 'spf', 'powder', '.', 'lasts', 'entire', 'day', 'long', 'camouflage', 'melted', 'candle', 'sagging', 'look', 'aging', 'eyes', 'subtle', 'color', 'correction', 'makes', 'dark', 'circles', 'magically', 'unnoticeable', '.', 'dont', 'know', 'type', 'technology', 'product', 'utilizes', 'goes', 'away', 'wash', '.', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'longterm', 'benefits', 'cares', 'incredible', 'completely', 'undetectable', 'skin', 'unlike', 'concealing', 'makeup', 'products', 'get', 'cakey', 'settle', 'lines', 'totally', 'obvious', '.', 'little', 'tube', 'lasts', 'forever', 'youre', 'not', 'happy', 'way', 'going', 'youre', 'probably', 'not', 'using', 'enough', 'youre', 'using', 'much', 'youre', 'not', 'putting', 'clean', 'dry', 'skin', 'youre', 'putting', 'something', '.', 'try', 'using', 'described', 'trust', 'see', 'difference', '.']"

i have used serious skincare for years. it has worked but the cons are that it cakes and you cannot use make up on it or under it because it defeats its purpose. i tried this product because it was more affordable and worth a chance. its perfect if used exactly according to directions. use on a clean area use very little and rub it in very gently avoid facial expressions for ten minutes and be patient. once its dry its exactly as it is advertised. it doesnt cake and looks just as good under makeup. the price is great compared to all the other brands so for me its a keeper. ,used serious skincare years . worked cons cakes not use make defeats purpose . tried product affordable worth chance . perfect used exactly according directions . use clean area use little rub gently avoid facial expressions ten minutes patient . dry exactly advertised . doesnt cake looks good makeup . price great compared brands keeper .,"['used', 'serious', 'skincare', 'years', '.', 'worked', 'cons', 'cakes', 'not', 'use', 'make', 'defeats', 'purpose', '.', 'tried', 'product', 'affordable', 'worth', 'chance', '.', 'perfect', 'used', 'exactly', 'according', 'directions', '.', 'use', 'clean', 'area', 'use', 'little', 'rub', 'gently', 'avoid', 'facial', 'expressions', 'ten', 'minutes', 'patient', '.', 'dry', 'exactly', 'advertised', '.', 'doesnt', 'cake', 'looks', 'good', 'makeup', '.', 'price', 'great', 'compared', 'brands', 'keeper', '.']"

the first time i tried this i practiced and watched videos and i really liked it at first but as the day went on it started leaving a white residue and cracking. i tried a few other products on amazon that were more expensive like the peter roth but those didnt do anything and had the same problems. they all worked at first but they all left a white residue no matter how little i put on. so i thought i would give this one more try after reading a review where someone said not to use a fan or a blow dryer. i put a tiny bit of this on used a little brush and upward strokes and then let it set for 5 minutes without using a fan my hand or a blow dryer. what do you know. it works. the picture above is after about 5 hours. normally i would have a white residue and crackling. looks pretty good dont you think i am 52 and i normally have some bags under my eyes along with some lines. this picture was snapped without any filter on my camera. i think im going to keep this bottle after all. my advice only use a tiny little bit use a brush to stroke upwards and then just let it sit. dont fan with your hand dont fan with anything at all dont use a hair dryer nothing. just let it sit for 5 minutes. the results are worth it. honestly if i have to reapply in another hour or so its still worth it. these eye bags have been the bane of my existence. changed my mind  takes practice,first time tried practiced watched videos really liked first day went started leaving white residue cracking . tried products amazon expensive like peter roth didnt anything problems . worked first left white residue no matter little put . thought would give one try reading review someone said not use fan blow dryer . put tiny bit used little brush upward strokes let set 5 minutes without using fan hand blow dryer . know . works . picture 5 hours . normally would white residue crackling . looks pretty good dont think 52 normally bags eyes along lines . picture snapped without filter camera . think im going keep bottle . advice use tiny little bit use brush stroke upwards let sit . dont fan hand dont fan anything dont use hair dryer nothing . let sit 5 minutes . results worth . honestly reapply another hour still worth . eye bags bane existence . changed mind takes practice,"['first', 'time', 'tried', 'practiced', 'watched', 'videos', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'day', 'went', 'started', 'leaving', 'white', 'residue', 'cracking', '.', 'tried', 'products', 'amazon', 'expensive', 'like', 'peter', 'roth', 'didnt', 'anything', 'problems', '.', 'worked', 'first', 'left', 'white', 'residue', 'no', 'matter', 'little', 'put', '.', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'reading', 'review', 'someone', 'said', 'not', 'use', 'fan', 'blow', 'dryer', '.', 'put', 'tiny', 'bit', 'used', 'little', 'brush', 'upward', 'strokes', 'let', 'set', '5', 'minutes', 'without', 'using', 'fan', 'hand', 'blow', 'dryer', '.', 'know', '.', 'works', '.', 'picture', '5', 'hours', '.', 'normally', 'would', 'white', 'residue', 'crackling', '.', 'looks', 'pretty', 'good', 'dont', 'think', '52', 'normally', 'bags', 'eyes', 'along', 'lines', '.', 'picture', 'snapped', 'without', 'filter', 'camera', '.', 'think', 'im', 'going', 'keep', 'bottle', '.', 'advice', 'use', 'tiny', 'little', 'bit', 'use', 'brush', 'stroke', 'upwards', 'let', 'sit', '.', 'dont', 'fan', 'hand', 'dont', 'fan', 'anything', 'dont', 'use', 'hair', 'dryer', 'nothing', '.', 'let', 'sit', '5', 'minutes', '.', 'results', 'worth', '.', 'honestly', 'reapply', 'another', 'hour', 'still', 'worth', '.', 'eye', 'bags', 'bane', 'existence', '.', 'changed', 'mind', 'takes', 'practice']"

i bought this thinking that if it didnt work id return it.  i was definitely skeptical but wanted to try it.  i have hereditarygenetic dark circles under my eyes and have had them for decades.  i put a tiny dab of the product on my finger. less than the size of the head of a map pin.  and dabbed it under only one eye so that i could compare with the other eye.  the tightening feeling started after about a minute and the appearance of the circle under my eye was greatly reduced almost immediately and looked much younger than the untreated eye.  i didnt get any white residue under my eye as some reviewers reported.  the directions do say that if you get that result youre using too much.  i couldnt possibly have dispensed less of it than what i did so im definitely not using a lot and it worked anyway.  thats great as far as im concerned.  you dont need to use much at all which will make this small container last a lot longer.  i did not put on moisturizer afterwards and i did not apply any other makeup but then i typically dont wear much makeup.  this product plumps up the area under my eye and makes the circle less noticeable.  the results last for hours. it took years off my face.  i tried it again the next day and used a bit more to see what would happen.  i got the antiaging look but also a tiny bit of white residue.  this is a case where less it more  i also tried it on laugh lines around my mouth but didnt see any noticeable results there.  no problem though i am very happy with what it does for my eyes.  i love this product.  im impressed and i will buy it again  four stars instead of five because the tightening feeling is a little offputting and some people may not like that. wow  i was skeptical but it works,bought thinking didnt work id return . definitely skeptical wanted try . hereditarygenetic dark circles eyes decades . put tiny dab product finger . less size head map pin . dabbed one eye could compare eye . tightening feeling started minute appearance circle eye greatly reduced almost immediately looked much younger untreated eye . didnt get white residue eye reviewers reported . directions say get result youre using much . couldnt possibly dispensed less im definitely not using lot worked anyway . thats great far im concerned . dont need use much make small container last lot longer . not put moisturizer afterwards not apply makeup typically dont wear much makeup . product plumps area eye makes circle less noticeable . results last hours . took years face . tried next day used bit see would happen . got antiaging look also tiny bit white residue . case less also tried laugh lines around mouth didnt see noticeable results . no problem though happy eyes . love product . im impressed buy four stars instead five tightening feeling little offputting people may not like . wow skeptical works,"['bought', 'thinking', 'didnt', 'work', 'id', 'return', '.', 'definitely', 'skeptical', 'wanted', 'try', '.', 'hereditarygenetic', 'dark', 'circles', 'eyes', 'decades', '.', 'put', 'tiny', 'dab', 'product', 'finger', '.', 'less', 'size', 'head', 'map', 'pin', '.', 'dabbed', 'one', 'eye', 'could', 'compare', 'eye', '.', 'tightening', 'feeling', 'started', 'minute', 'appearance', 'circle', 'eye', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'almost', 'immediately', 'looked', 'much', 'younger', 'untreated', 'eye', '.', 'didnt', 'get', 'white', 'residue', 'eye', 'reviewers', 'reported', '.', 'directions', 'say', 'get', 'result', 'youre', 'using', 'much', '.', 'couldnt', 'possibly', 'dispensed', 'less', 'im', 'definitely', 'not', 'using', 'lot', 'worked', 'anyway', '.', 'thats', 'great', 'far', 'im', 'concerned', '.', 'dont', 'need', 'use', 'much', 'make', 'small', 'container', 'last', 'lot', 'longer', '.', 'not', 'put', 'moisturizer', 'afterwards', 'not', 'apply', 'makeup', 'typically', 'dont', 'wear', 'much', 'makeup', '.', 'product', 'plumps', 'area', 'eye', 'makes', 'circle', 'less', 'noticeable', '.', 'results', 'last', 'hours', '.', 'took', 'years', 'face', '.', 'tried', 'next', 'day', 'used', 'bit', 'see', 'would', 'happen', '.', 'got', 'antiaging', 'look', 'also', 'tiny', 'bit', 'white', 'residue', '.', 'case', 'less', 'also', 'tried', 'laugh', 'lines', 'around', 'mouth', 'didnt', 'see', 'noticeable', 'results', '.', 'no', 'problem', 'though', 'happy', 'eyes', '.', 'love', 'product', '.', 'im', 'impressed', 'buy', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'tightening', 'feeling', 'little', 'offputting', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'like', '.', 'wow', 'skeptical', 'works']"

after turning fiftysix i noticed that i had bags under my eyes for the first time in my life. i notice the same thing on my husband and we both decided to stop drinking and make sure we got 8 hours of sleep per night. however to our chagrin the bags did not disappear. so we also decided for health reasons to go vegan. we both lost weight going vegan and found our energy was vastly improved. however the bags under our eyes remained. we both looked tired and older due to our under eyebags. after seeing the informational on this product we decided to try it. it absolutely works. yes we have to battle the occasional drying out of the product around our eyes but we have found that if we simply dab water on our dry spots then the paste disappears again re news itself and lifts the bags.the occasional dryness would never prevent me from using this product. it truly works as for those who are concerned about not being able to use makeup with it. my routine is to put all of my products on my face and skin. i dont use a heavy foundation. i just simply use elta md tinted sunscreen. i do apply blush and powder.  and then i put on my very small dab of product under both eyes. set a timer for 10 minutes. try not to move the muscles in my face. during that time and wella. i have younger looking eyes than i ever had.  even in my 40s. i am a true believer and will continue to use this product for as long as they sell it. ,turning fiftysix noticed bags eyes first time life . notice thing husband decided stop drinking make sure got 8 hours sleep per night . however chagrin bags not disappear . also decided health reasons go vegan . lost weight going vegan found energy vastly improved . however bags eyes remained . looked tired older due eyebags . seeing informational product decided try . absolutely works . yes battle occasional drying product around eyes found simply dab water dry spots paste disappears news lifts bags.the occasional dryness would never prevent using product . truly works concerned not able use makeup . routine put products face skin . dont use heavy foundation . simply use elta md tinted sunscreen . apply blush powder . put small dab product eyes . set timer 10 minutes . try not move muscles face . time wella . younger looking eyes ever . even 40s . true believer continue use product long sell .,"['turning', 'fiftysix', 'noticed', 'bags', 'eyes', 'first', 'time', 'life', '.', 'notice', 'thing', 'husband', 'decided', 'stop', 'drinking', 'make', 'sure', 'got', '8', 'hours', 'sleep', 'per', 'night', '.', 'however', 'chagrin', 'bags', 'not', 'disappear', '.', 'also', 'decided', 'health', 'reasons', 'go', 'vegan', '.', 'lost', 'weight', 'going', 'vegan', 'found', 'energy', 'vastly', 'improved', '.', 'however', 'bags', 'eyes', 'remained', '.', 'looked', 'tired', 'older', 'due', 'eyebags', '.', 'seeing', 'informational', 'product', 'decided', 'try', '.', 'absolutely', 'works', '.', 'yes', 'battle', 'occasional', 'drying', 'product', 'around', 'eyes', 'found', 'simply', 'dab', 'water', 'dry', 'spots', 'paste', 'disappears', 'news', 'lifts', 'bags.the', 'occasional', 'dryness', 'would', 'never', 'prevent', 'using', 'product', '.', 'truly', 'works', 'concerned', 'not', 'able', 'use', 'makeup', '.', 'routine', 'put', 'products', 'face', 'skin', '.', 'dont', 'use', 'heavy', 'foundation', '.', 'simply', 'use', 'elta', 'md', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', '.', 'apply', 'blush', 'powder', '.', 'put', 'small', 'dab', 'product', 'eyes', '.', 'set', 'timer', '10', 'minutes', '.', 'try', 'not', 'move', 'muscles', 'face', '.', 'time', 'wella', '.', 'younger', 'looking', 'eyes', 'ever', '.', 'even', '40s', '.', 'true', 'believer', 'continue', 'use', 'product', 'long', 'sell', '.']"

as a 57yrold man i like to look my best but am certainly not the metrosexual type.  admittedly i have not made my skin health a priority over my lifetime but i feel that i do not show my age.  i have used respectable mens cleansing products as well as moderatelypriced serums and moisturizers on my face and they work okay on the fine lines and dark circles around my eyes.i had seen the commercial advertising for plaxaderm and really didnt think much of a cosmetic product that cost so much and made exorbitant claims.  but after many months of commercials i decided what the heck and i purchased it through amazon instead of direct from the vendor.for the price the tube is really small but the suggested tiny amount spreads very well so it goes a long way.  maybe it evens out in the end.if it really works.i used my wifes lighted magnifying mirror to look at the fine lines around my eyes before using the product and an hour or so after applying the product.  my opinion is that it really didnt make the dramatic difference suggested by the advertising and it certainly did not do any better than the products i had been using at 13 of the price.  the dark circles under my eyes are not that bad and it didnt do much for me in that respect either.i do not want to waste my money by tossing it out so i will use up the rest of the product.  my suggestion is to compare plaxaderm to products making similar claims and try the less expensive options first. not as dramatic as the advertising suggests.,57yrold man like look best certainly not metrosexual type . admittedly not made skin health priority lifetime feel not show age . used respectable mens cleansing products well moderatelypriced serums moisturizers face work okay fine lines dark circles around eyes.i seen commercial advertising plaxaderm really didnt think much cosmetic product cost much made exorbitant claims . many months commercials decided heck purchased amazon instead direct vendor.for price tube really small suggested tiny amount spreads well goes long way . maybe evens end.if really works.i used wifes lighted magnifying mirror look fine lines around eyes using product hour applying product . opinion really didnt make dramatic difference suggested advertising certainly not better products using 13 price . dark circles eyes not bad didnt much respect either.i not want waste money tossing use rest product . suggestion compare plaxaderm products making similar claims try less expensive options first . not dramatic advertising suggests .,"['57yrold', 'man', 'like', 'look', 'best', 'certainly', 'not', 'metrosexual', 'type', '.', 'admittedly', 'not', 'made', 'skin', 'health', 'priority', 'lifetime', 'feel', 'not', 'show', 'age', '.', 'used', 'respectable', 'mens', 'cleansing', 'products', 'well', 'moderatelypriced', 'serums', 'moisturizers', 'face', 'work', 'okay', 'fine', 'lines', 'dark', 'circles', 'around', 'eyes.i', 'seen', 'commercial', 'advertising', 'plaxaderm', 'really', 'didnt', 'think', 'much', 'cosmetic', 'product', 'cost', 'much', 'made', 'exorbitant', 'claims', '.', 'many', 'months', 'commercials', 'decided', 'heck', 'purchased', 'amazon', 'instead', 'direct', 'vendor.for', 'price', 'tube', 'really', 'small', 'suggested', 'tiny', 'amount', 'spreads', 'well', 'goes', 'long', 'way', '.', 'maybe', 'evens', 'end.if', 'really', 'works.i', 'used', 'wifes', 'lighted', 'magnifying', 'mirror', 'look', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', 'using', 'product', 'hour', 'applying', 'product', '.', 'opinion', 'really', 'didnt', 'make', 'dramatic', 'difference', 'suggested', 'advertising', 'certainly', 'not', 'better', 'products', 'using', '13', 'price', '.', 'dark', 'circles', 'eyes', 'not', 'bad', 'didnt', 'much', 'respect', 'either.i', 'not', 'want', 'waste', 'money', 'tossing', 'use', 'rest', 'product', '.', 'suggestion', 'compare', 'plaxaderm', 'products', 'making', 'similar', 'claims', 'try', 'less', 'expensive', 'options', 'first', '.', 'not', 'dramatic', 'advertising', 'suggests', '.']"

so this product itself works great.  the problem is the pump keeps breaking.  i thought my first bottle was near empty  so i bought a second bottle.  in 2 weeks i couldnt get it to pump out again.  thats when i realized the pump was the problem with the first bottle as well as second one.  i  checked it and the first bottle was indeed at least 12 full.  the dark label makes it hard to see content.  i decided to try and use the product by unscrewing top and dabbing it under my eyes.  it worked fine for awhile  but this kind of product is not supposed to be exposed air  so opening it every morning quickly decreased the effectiveness of the product and it started to dry out a little in the bottle.  im really bummed about spending the money on a product i like but cant use.  i havent ask for a refund or replacement.  maybe i should.  i  just bought a new brand  i have used a variety of these products for years and its not even close to as good as this product. its essynaturals. im sad to say i will be writing an unfavorable review on it. i hope the makers of instaderm improve the dispenser or just put it in a tube  i would like to be able to buy the product again. i would also like to add i could not find a way to contact instaderm to talk about the 2 broken pumps. ,product works great . problem pump keeps breaking . thought first bottle near empty bought second bottle . 2 weeks couldnt get pump . thats realized pump problem first bottle well second one . checked first bottle indeed least 12 full . dark label makes hard see content . decided try use product unscrewing top dabbing eyes . worked fine awhile kind product not supposed exposed air opening every morning quickly decreased effectiveness product started dry little bottle . im really bummed spending money product like cant use . havent ask refund replacement . maybe . bought new brand used variety products years not even close good product . essynaturals . im sad say writing unfavorable review . hope makers instaderm improve dispenser put tube would like able buy product . would also like add could not find way contact instaderm talk 2 broken pumps .,"['product', 'works', 'great', '.', 'problem', 'pump', 'keeps', 'breaking', '.', 'thought', 'first', 'bottle', 'near', 'empty', 'bought', 'second', 'bottle', '.', '2', 'weeks', 'couldnt', 'get', 'pump', '.', 'thats', 'realized', 'pump', 'problem', 'first', 'bottle', 'well', 'second', 'one', '.', 'checked', 'first', 'bottle', 'indeed', 'least', '12', 'full', '.', 'dark', 'label', 'makes', 'hard', 'see', 'content', '.', 'decided', 'try', 'use', 'product', 'unscrewing', 'top', 'dabbing', 'eyes', '.', 'worked', 'fine', 'awhile', 'kind', 'product', 'not', 'supposed', 'exposed', 'air', 'opening', 'every', 'morning', 'quickly', 'decreased', 'effectiveness', 'product', 'started', 'dry', 'little', 'bottle', '.', 'im', 'really', 'bummed', 'spending', 'money', 'product', 'like', 'cant', 'use', '.', 'havent', 'ask', 'refund', 'replacement', '.', 'maybe', '.', 'bought', 'new', 'brand', 'used', 'variety', 'products', 'years', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'good', 'product', '.', 'essynaturals', '.', 'im', 'sad', 'say', 'writing', 'unfavorable', 'review', '.', 'hope', 'makers', 'instaderm', 'improve', 'dispenser', 'put', 'tube', 'would', 'like', 'able', 'buy', 'product', '.', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'contact', 'instaderm', 'talk', '2', 'broken', 'pumps', '.']"

i almost never write reviews but after reading so many who do not like this product i thought i would say something that could be helpful. the bags wrinkles and circles are nearly gone after i use this product  and i am able to smile and do whatever for an entire day with full effect. you cant touch the area after its applied though so no messing around with your eye i apply my moisturizer first and then undereye concealer and blush. when its dry i apply a thin layer of instaderm all around the under eye around the corners and at the very top of my cheek where sometimes theres a little puffiness. the makeup doesnt come off and there is no white crud once in a while when i first press the pump there is a bit of hard crustiness at the tip.  just wipe that off before using it and continue so you are using only the gel. honestly im addicted  i will use this product forever i do worry a bit about dryness but continue to use my moisturizers in the morning and at night. good luck ,almost never write reviews reading many not like product thought would say something could helpful . bags wrinkles circles nearly gone use product able smile whatever entire day full effect . cant touch area applied though no messing around eye apply moisturizer first undereye concealer blush . dry apply thin layer instaderm around eye around corners top cheek sometimes theres little puffiness . makeup doesnt come no white crud first press pump bit hard crustiness tip . wipe using continue using gel . honestly im addicted use product forever worry bit dryness continue use moisturizers morning night . good luck,"['almost', 'never', 'write', 'reviews', 'reading', 'many', 'not', 'like', 'product', 'thought', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'could', 'helpful', '.', 'bags', 'wrinkles', 'circles', 'nearly', 'gone', 'use', 'product', 'able', 'smile', 'whatever', 'entire', 'day', 'full', 'effect', '.', 'cant', 'touch', 'area', 'applied', 'though', 'no', 'messing', 'around', 'eye', 'apply', 'moisturizer', 'first', 'undereye', 'concealer', 'blush', '.', 'dry', 'apply', 'thin', 'layer', 'instaderm', 'around', 'eye', 'around', 'corners', 'top', 'cheek', 'sometimes', 'theres', 'little', 'puffiness', '.', 'makeup', 'doesnt', 'come', 'no', 'white', 'crud', 'first', 'press', 'pump', 'bit', 'hard', 'crustiness', 'tip', '.', 'wipe', 'using', 'continue', 'using', 'gel', '.', 'honestly', 'im', 'addicted', 'use', 'product', 'forever', 'worry', 'bit', 'dryness', 'continue', 'use', 'moisturizers', 'morning', 'night', '.', 'good', 'luck']"

im a major skincare product lover but honestly most of the time i dont bother getting eye creams. i am in my 30s and have some fine lines around my eye area but no major concerns with dark circles crows feet etc. my skin type is combination and this area of my face definitely tends to get a little dry and sensitive though. unfortunately this means that lots of eye creams are too thick goopy or heavy for me or even worse have some sort of fragrance thats irritating. many of them are also ridiculously expensive. ive had good luck with a lot of products from the eight saints brand though so i decided to give this one a trypackagingfirst thing i usually notice is the packaging. this comes in a cute little glass jar that makes it easy to get out with a fingertip or spatula. i also like this format because i feel like i can get all the product out whereas theres always some left behind that wont come out when they come in little tubes. the jar is also good enough quality that ill wash it out and reuse for something else when the eye cream is all used up. size is 15ml which i think is pretty standard amount for this kind of product.scenti sniffed this over and over like a weirdo because i really wanted to give a good description of the scent but honestly i cannot smell a thing unlike some fragrancefree products that smell weird because they didnt add fragrance to them i truly dont think this eye cream smells like anything. perfect. thumbs up.textureagain my usual peeve with eye creams is that they can be heavy too thick or feel greasy. i was really pleasantly surprised by the texture of this. its thick enough to feel rich but the best way i think id describe it is that instead of feeling creamy it almost feels like it has slip to it. kind of unusual and so niceresultsi have been using all in for about a week so i cant yet see improvement in fine lines but i certainly wouldnt expect to so quickly. however i can definitely say my eye area feels much better hydrated. the skin is feeling moisturized soft and plumper  ive noticed my makeup doesnt sink in to the little lines like it sometimes would before i use this both morning and evening and think its a good addition to my skincare routine.so if youre like me and dont usually like eye cream all in just might be the eye cream for you too. reasonably priced super hydrating and nonsmelly im glad i gave it a try and will definitely be keeping it as part of my routine. confession  i usually dont buy eye creams this one is worth it.,im major skincare product lover honestly time dont bother getting eye

i have been using this eye cream for a week now and will admit im lazy and have only been using it in the morning not at night.  i feel this has really worked great for just the one time a day use however i realize i need to change that routine.at nearly 62 years old obviously i have concerns of lines wrinkles puffiness and just a general tired look around my eyes and have worries about lackluster skin. i have used other eye creams throughout my life but not one that feels quite as nice as this. its not sticky or greasy and seems to be more absorbable and it really does help with the puffy underneath as well as the lessening appearance of crow feet around my eyes.  taking the picture im actually quite surprised as to how nice my under eye area looks and the lack of circles as i dont sleep well thus the need for the creams and i feel like i always look tired.the cream has a nice consistency and really it only takes a little dab to pat all around underneath. i think now seeing the photo that im going to dab some above the eye as well because its clear to me that my skin care in that area has been lacking  i really like the hyaluronic acid in the cream as a great hydrator it really does the job its supposed to do i use the remaining cream on my hand around my top lip for the lip lines i got when i was a smoker.theres a very light scent to the product but i see theres no added fragrance just the normal ingredients maybe the scent im picking up is cucumber as its hard to discern. my under eye area feels very well hydrated and stays just like that for the rest of the day which i love because i am not one to keep playing with my face and skin all day im too busy for that nonsense as a nurse. i appreciate a skin care product without a bunch of added chemicals that could potentially damage my skin and health as welli have had absolutely zero reaction or sensitivity to this product no redness itching etc. i have normal skin with occasional sensitivities and my sensitivities are almost always related to fragrance that is added so i truly appreciate there is no added fragrance to this eye cream.highly recommended for any age group eight saints  eye cream is a

this is a great eye cream. after years of neglecting the skin under my eyes i started to use a moisturizer. the first one i tried caused the occasional breakout so i switched to all in eye cream. the breakouts have completely disappeared.all in leaves my skin smooth and soft. my eyes are brighter and less puffy. i noticed a big improvement after a few weeks of regular use. i generally use it both in the morning and night now. a little goes a long way with this stuff i probably get three months or more out of the small jar.the biggest thing for me was that i had developed what i think was milia over the years. not sure if the cream made them actually disappear or perhaps due to the fact that the skin under my eyes is just much more plump now but the small bumps i had under my eyes are almost completely gone they are pretty much unnoticeable now. this was totally unexpected and to me speaks volumes about the importance of a good eye cream. the skin around and under my eyes looks and feels so much better this cream is something i make a point to always have with me. great eye cream with unexpected benefit,great eye cream . years neglecting skin eyes started use moisturizer . first one tried caused occasional breakout switched eye cream . breakouts completely disappeared.all leaves skin smooth soft . eyes brighter less puffy . noticed big improvement weeks regular use . generally use morning night . little goes long way stuff probably get three months small jar.the biggest thing developed think milia years . not sure cream made actually disappear perhaps due fact skin eyes much plump small bumps eyes almost completely gone pretty much unnoticeable . totally unexpected speaks volumes importance good eye cream . skin around eyes looks feels much better cream something make point always . great eye cream unexpected benefit,"['great', 'eye', 'cream', '.', 'years', 'neglecting', 'skin', 'eyes', 'started', 'use', 'moisturizer', '.', 'first', 'one', 'tried', 'caused', 'occasional', 'breakout', 'switched', 'eye', 'cream', '.', 'breakouts', 'completely', 'disappeared.all', 'leaves', 'skin', 'smooth', 'soft', '.', 'eyes', 'brighter', 'less', 'puffy', '.', 'noticed', 'big', 'improvement', 'weeks', 'regular', 'use', '.', 'generally', 'use', 'morning', 'night', '.', 'little', 'goes', 'long', 'way', 'stuff', 'probably', 'get', 'three', 'months', 'small', 'jar.the', 'biggest', 'thing', 'developed', 'think', 'milia', 'years', '.', 'not', 'sure', 'cream', 'made', 'actually', 'disappear', 'perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'skin', 'eyes', 'much', 'plump', 'small', 'bumps', 'eyes', 'almost', 'completely', 'gone', 'pretty', 'much', 'unnoticeable', '.', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'importance', 'good', 'eye', 'cream', '.', 'skin', 'around', 'eyes', 'looks', 'feels', 'much', 'better', 'cream', 'something', 'make', 'point', 'always', '.', 'great', 'eye', 'cream', 'unexpected', 'benefit']"

i do think my dark circles are looking better and this moisturizes my under eyes well.  my only complaint is the dispenser.  its a pump and its so hard sometimes to get just a little bit of the cream.  ive had to waste some of the cream a couple of times now because too much was dispensed.  youd have more control if it was a squeeze dispenser. ,think dark circles looking better moisturizes eyes well . complaint dispenser . pump hard sometimes get little bit cream . ive waste cream couple times much dispensed . youd control squeeze dispenser .,"['think', 'dark', 'circles', 'looking', 'better', 'moisturizes', 'eyes', 'well', '.', 'complaint', 'dispenser', '.', 'pump', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'cream', '.', 'ive', 'waste', 'cream', 'couple', 'times', 'much', 'dispensed', '.', 'youd', 'control', 'squeeze', 'dispenser', '.']"

ive used eight saints products for the last two years or so.  i have very sensitive skin and it is one of the only brands i can use that i dont have a negative reaction to while still seeing a positive improvement.ive used their original under eye cream for almost a year but i didnt notice too much of a difference.  being middleaged i realized that i needed something a bit more powerful for my under eye issues.ive started to get very noticeable thinning and crepeyness under my eyes.  it drives me nuts  im not very educated when it comes to skincare products so i was so excited to see that eight saints had an under eye cream that was specifically antiaging.i really like how the applicator works.  it allows an even delicate application of the product.after using the product for about a week i did start to notice a subtle plumpness.  i also noticed that the wrinklycrepey looking folds were improved as well.  im hoping as i use the product longer that some of the bluish tint due to my thin skin will improve.i recommend this product if youre just starting to struggle with the signs of aging especially if you have sensitive skin like me it definitely added some plumpness,ive used eight saints products last two years . sensitive skin one brands use dont negative reaction still seeing positive improvement.ive used original eye cream almost year didnt notice much difference . middleaged realized needed something bit powerful eye issues.ive started get noticeable thinning crepeyness eyes . drives nuts im not educated comes skincare products excited see eight saints eye cream specifically antiaging.i really like applicator works . allows even delicate application product.after using product week start notice subtle plumpness . also noticed wrinklycrepey looking folds improved well . im hoping use product longer bluish tint due thin skin improve.i recommend product youre starting struggle signs aging especially sensitive skin like definitely added plumpness,"['ive', 'used', 'eight', 'saints', 'products', 'last', 'two', 'years', '.', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'one', 'brands', 'use', 'dont', 'negative', 'reaction', 'still', 'seeing', 'positive', 'improvement.ive', 'used', 'original', 'eye', 'cream', 'almost', 'year', 'didnt', 'notice', 'much', 'difference', '.', 'middleaged', 'realized', 'needed', 'something', 'bit', 'powerful', 'eye', 'issues.ive', 'started', 'get', 'noticeable', 'thinning', 'crepeyness', 'eyes', '.', 'drives', 'nuts', 'im', 'not', 'educated', 'comes', 'skincare', 'products', 'excited', 'see', 'eight', 'saints', 'eye', 'cream', 'specifically', 'antiaging.i', 'really', 'like', 'applicator', 'works', '.', 'allows', 'even', 'delicate', 'application', 'product.after', 'using', 'product', 'week', 'start', 'notice', 'subtle', 'plumpness', '.', 'also', 'noticed', 'wrinklycrepey', 'looking', 'folds', 'improved', 'well', '.', 'im', 'hoping', 'use', 'product', 'longer', 'bluish', 'tint', 'due', 'thin', 'skin', 'improve.i', 'recommend', 'product', 'youre', 'starting', 'struggle', 'signs', 'aging', 'especially', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'like', 'definitely', 'added', 'plumpness']"
i have been impressed by every eight saints product ive tried.  this eye cream is no exception.  the applicator makes it feel cool on the skin and allows you to control the amount of cream you want to use.  honestly i use it above my eyes and on the 11 between my brows as well.  how i first tested it was on the back of my hand.  hands show your age  but i have to tell you  the section i used it on stayed smooth the entire day.  used 2x a day despite not sleeping well over the last several weeks i dont look tired and i honestly cant wait to put it on  it does help if your skin is slightly damp otherwise the applicator will tug slightly.  or you can dab on the cream and then spread it with the applicator.  my favorite part of my morning and evening skin routine at this point.  try it youll love it impressed by every eight saints product i try  this is no exception,impressed every eight saints product ive tried . eye cream no exception . applicator makes feel cool skin allows control amount cream want use . honestly use eyes 11 brows well . first tested back hand . hands show age tell section used stayed smooth entire day . used 2x day despite not sleeping well last several weeks dont look tired honestly cant wait put help skin slightly damp otherwise applicator tug slightly . dab cream spread applicator . favorite part morning evening skin routine point . try youll love impressed every eight saints product try no exception,"['impressed', 'every', 'eight', 'saints', 'product', 'ive', 'tried', '.', 'eye', 'cream', 'no', 'exception', '.', 'applicator', 'makes', 'feel', 'cool', 'skin', 'allows', 'control', 'amount', 'cream', 'want', 'use', '.', 'honestly', 'use', 'eyes', '11', 'brows', 'well', '.', 'first', 'tested', 'back', 'hand', '.', 'hands', 'show', 'age', 'tell', 'section', 'used', 'stayed', 'smooth', 'entire', 'day', '.', 'used', '2x', 'day', 'despite', 'not', 'sleeping', 'well', 'last', 'several', 'weeks', 'dont', 'look', 'tired', 'honestly', 'cant', 'wait', 'put', 'help', 'skin', 'slightly', 'damp', 'otherwise', 'applicator', 'tug', 'slightly', '.', 'dab', 'cream', 'spread', 'applicator', '.', 'favorite', 'part', 'morning', 'evening', 'skin', 'routine', 'point', '.', 'try', 'youll', 'love', 'impressed', 'every', 'eight', 'saints', 'product', 'try', 'no', 'exception']"

first off ignore my eyebrows in these photos. ive had a crazy week and it shows. i wanted to take these unedited barefaced photos because i need to spread the good word so lets get into it. please understand i am not at all the person who throws caution to the wind and puts naked skin photos on the internet. i am doing this for you dear reader so stay with mei wish i had a before photo to show you. know why i dont because i didnt expect this to work. i am one of those people blessed with genetic undereye dark circles  puffiness and its something thats bothered me since adolescence. im 41 now and also somewhat of a skincare junkie. this means ive tried a lot of eye cream  patches  treatments over the years from cheaper to pricier.none of which have ever managed to impress me. until this one.first of all ive had nightmare allergies lately and my order happened to come in when i felt like death. i took it out of the package with zero expecations. i mean if my hopes were on a scale of 110 i was at a 0. nothing ever really works at least not in a noticeable or impressive way and i expected the same from this. i didnt feel well and i wanted a burst of serotonin from opening my amazon package. that is the only reason i opened it when i did. to my surprise what i noticed immediately was that the metal applicator feels incredible under your eyes.most definitely when youre struggling with allergies. it was very soothing and i decided i would continue using it for that reason alone. i have applied it religiously during my morning and nighttime routine over the past nine days. i decided to sit down and write this review because i am in shock. nothing in my 25 years of trying to banish my dark circles has ever lightened them. ever. this did not only that but there is some other level of sorcery in the formula that also decreased the puffiness. i have checked myself out in multiple mirrors and in different lighting to make sure im not losing it. my undereyes are for real lighter and less puffy and its been less than two weeks. turning 40 last year hit me like a ton of bricks and ive been at an alltime low in terms of feeling pretty and noticing the less than awesome changes in my skin. this is the first time in forever that ive been able to see legitimate improvement. because i have no before photos to show you look at my afters and know that 1 my undereyes were a lot darker than this 2 in the photo where i tilt my chin down that angle typically looks way puffier and its something thats always bothered me.i dont even know what else to say except this if youve had a similar struggle over the years  you hate looking tired no matter what you do but dont want to go the injectable route.try this stuff. seriously just try it. it isnt an instant miracle nothing is but if you make it a part of your regular routine.for once it will actually pay off. i cant say enough good things and now i want to try the entire product line to see what other magic they have cooking up over there ,first ignore eyebrows photos . ive crazy week shows . wanted take unedited barefaced photos need spread good word lets get . please understand not person

i swear everytime i get a different eight saints product that i havent tried yet it becomes my favorite and just when i think i have decided which one is the best i try another one and then its all up in the air again. eight saints you make it so difficult  okay enough of that lets get to the product. this is called wonderfill a new eye cream added to their line. i was so excited to try this when it first came out but it had already sold out on their website by the time i was able to purchase it. so i waited waited waited patiently for it to be in stock again then saw since they now have a storefront here on amazon it finally was added on here a little after the launch of this on the website. as soon as i saw this get in stock i grabbed it and i am so glad i did because it went out of stock on here not long after i ordered. this is really good eye cream. i got this to use during my morning skincare routine. i have noticed while there is a plethora of eye cream products out there to choose from most are heavy and much more suitable and reared toward a night time use so i wanted to find something that would be light and able to be used quickly and easily and would work not only under makeup but could be used with makeup and lastly something that would of course actually work. this product exceeded my expectations and all my wants of what i was looking for in a product. this comes in a long slender tube with a silver colored cooling applicator tip. this aids in getting blood circulation going and perking up your eyes like a caffienated product does. i especially love this feature because instead of using your finger the tip helps with not pulling on your eye area which is the most delicate spot on your face and you dont want to do alot of pulling or tugging around in that area. there is alot of product in this and will last you a long time. i usually use the all in eight saints eye cream but i use that in the evening and wanted something to use for my a.m. skincare routine. this can be used for both p.m. and for a.m. and works good for both but the morning timeday use with this is best. the key ingredients are niacinamide peptides hyaluronic acid and vitamin e. this is going to give you a filled in look that actually lasts throughout the whole day. this has a creamy texture and is white in color. it goes on your skin white but once rubbed in its clear and you see no color left behind. this has no scent and is great for all skin types and very good even for sensitive skin. this does not cause any breakouts or purging no skin reactions and will not make your eyes itchy. this will cause any puffiness to go down completely will make your undereye hydrated so its plumped looking fills in wrinkles and softens the look of any emerging lines and will cover and reduce dark undereye circles. this goes on wonderfully under makeup and does not pill or clump. it actually helps make a priming effect for your concealer and foundation keeping it from settling into any lines and caking up. if you decide to not wear it with makeup or under makeup you dont look like you have product applied under your eyes and doesnt look greasy or wet. for an added boost you can keep this in the refrigerator or a mini makeupskincare fridge and will provide an extra cooling effect with the metal tip and will take away all puffiness. also i find that if you want to use this with a p.m. routine put this on first then your regular eye cream over it and it works superb as well. when using this make sure to apply this after your cleanse and your face is still damp because hyaluronic acid thrives in moisture so you definitely want to apply when your face is damp after cleansing or after you apply your toner so you get the benefits of this product and so it works on your skin.extra info on eight saints and why i love this brandall products made in the u.s.a.non toxic plant based natural and organic ingredientsno syntheticscertified cruelty free and

this is the third type of eye cream ive tried from eight saints and its another one i quite like though i feel like its the one ill reach for most often as a specific spot treatment rather than a daily eye cream based on my own particular needs. this works as well as the other two their eye gel and eye brightening cream on fine lines and generally firming up the areas around the eye. where this seems to really do an excellent job is to fill in sunken areas under the eye. if i use this plumping cream on one side and the brightening cream on the other the side with the plumping cream is much more even overall and doesnt have the deeper lines and bags under my eyes. when i was really tired after a long and exciting thanksgiving day this cream made me look almost human againbut one of my main eye concerns is puffy bags under the eyes above where i have sunken areas or bags and this works less well on reducing the swelling in that area than the eye gel or brightening cream from eight saints. since thats more of my daily concern ill continue to use those as my regular items but will absolutely keep this plumping cream on hand for the days when exhaustion is particularly visible on my face and id like to erase it work great for filling in fine lines and sunken eyes from lack of sleep,third type eye cream ive tried eight saints another one quite like though feel like one ill reach often specific spot treatment rather daily eye cream based particular needs . works well two eye gel eye brightening cream fine lines generally firming areas around eye . seems really excellent job fill sunken areas eye . use plumping cream one side brightening cream side plumping cream much even overall doesnt deeper lines bags eyes . really tired long exciting thanksgiving day cream made look almost human againbut one main eye concerns puffy bags eyes sunken areas bags works less well reducing swelling area eye gel brightening cream eight saints . since thats daily concern ill continue use regular items absolutely keep plumping cream hand days exhaustion particularly visible face id like erase work great filling fine lines sunken eyes lack sleep,"['third', 'type', 'eye', 'cream', 'ive', 'tried', 'eight', 'saints', 'another', 'one', 'quite', 'like', 'though', 'feel', 'like', 'one', 'ill', 'reach', 'often', 'specific', 'spot', 'treatment', 'rather', 'daily', 'eye', 'cream', 'based', 'particular', 'needs', '.', 'works', 'well', 'two', 'eye', 'gel', 'eye', 'brightening', 'cream', 'fine', 'lines', 'generally', 'firming', 'areas', 'around', 'eye', '.', 'seems', 'really', 'excellent', 'job', 'fill', 'sunken', 'areas', 'eye', '.', 'use', 'plumping', 'cream', 'one', 'side', 'brightening', 'cream', 'side', 'plumping', 'cream', 'much', 'even', 'overall', 'doesnt', 'deeper', 'lines', 'bags', 'eyes', '.', 'really', 'tired', 'long', 'exciting', 'thanksgiving', 'day', 'cream', 'made', 'look', 'almost', 'human', 'againbut', 'one', 'main', 'eye', 'concerns', 'puffy', 'bags', 'eyes', 'sunken', 'areas', 'bags', 'works', 'less', 'well', 'reducing', 'swelling', 'area', 'eye', 'gel', 'brightening', 'cream', 'eight', 'saints', '.', 'since', 'thats', 'daily', 'concern', 'ill', 'continue', 'use', 'regular', 'items', 'absolutely', 'keep', 'plumping', 'cream', 'hand', 'days', 'exhaustion', 'particularly', 'visible', 'face', 'id', 'like', 'erase', 'work', 'great', 'filling', 'fine', 'lines', 'sunken', 'eyes', 'lack', 'sleep']"

update 623its been almost a week since i added extra jojoba oil to my eye routine vitamin c jojoba oil eye cream retinoid. i sort of gave up on using the face cream since it seems like its too thin plus the combination of retinoid and face cream on my neck gave me rash. im happy to say that it helps a lot my under eyes fine lines and tiredness seemed to be improving overnight after using the combination of vitamin c a tiny drop of jojoba oil eye cream and retinoid. it might be because the skin under my eyes is way too dry compared to the rest of my face remember when putting every single item that a little bit goes a long way. i just used a super tiny drop of jojoba oil on my ring finger which normally enough for both eyes and start dabbing. the key is layering. dab each product on your skin lightly let it absorb for a few minutes before going to the next product. just think of it as painting. you wouldnt want to start a new fresh paint on top of a wet paint would you cs was really excellent in getting back to me for a full refund. i did email them for a full refund but also mentioned that i was very conflicted about it so ill leave it up to them if they want to refund it or not its been exactly a month since i received the eye cream retinoid and face cream that i feel good to write a review. this review is based on just the eye cream and i will do a separate review on the other two update seems like i cant do a separate review on their retinoid and face cream. oh wells.a little background about my skin its very oily has some hormonal acne and im approaching late 30s. for almost a year ive been trying to switch all of my face products to a more natural kind by using tea tree oil face wash alcohol free toner vitamin c serum and a concoction of 6 drops of jojoba oil 4 drops of rosehip seed oil and 4 drops of tea tree oil. unfortunately its not enough for my stubborn hormonal acne and im sick of looking like i just hit puberty.so i stumble upon this brand and it piques my interest. 3000 mostly positive reviews and i thought why not i love the cute packaging and the fact that its air pump so the cream will stay clean. be gentle when dispensing it as you can easily dispense too much. i use this three times a day morning before work evening after work and at night before bedtime. i washed my face this time with face wash with some salicylic acid per doctors instruction toner and vitamin c serum. i put three dots of the eye cream under my eyes two dots on my eyelids and start to dab.the cream is pretty light and it absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy feeling. i was excited to see the result so i used this religiously and a month later im sad to say that i dont see any result. the lines under my eyes are still there and somehow my bb cream went cakey when used over it.last night i tried a dab of jojoba oil on each eye dab the eye cream over it when its dry and went to bed. this morning im happy to report that i saw a significant improvement the lines under my eyes were significantly reduced and my eyes looked plumper. ill try it again later and maybe write an updated review on this new method.im honestly torn about this cream. do i love it meh. do i hate it no. am i going to buy it again meh. well see what happen after this bottle but my point is i shouldnt have to add extra product to see it working. not seeing any result,update 623its almost week since added extra jojoba oil eye routine vitamin c jojoba oil eye cream retinoid . sort gave using face cream since seems like thin plus combination retinoid face cream neck gave rash . im happy say helps lot eyes fine lines tiredness seemed improving overnight using combination vitamin c tiny drop jojoba oil eye cream retinoid . might skin eyes way dry

i bought this eye cream for my hubby and he absolutely loves it at first he was skeptical about using it just like any other guy would be considering the fact that the average guy doesnt really do much with their skin. im so glad he finally started using it though because the cream has been put to good use and hes also happy he started using it because this eye area looks really good. its no longer puffer and his skin is even as compared to before when it had darkened due to sun exposure. the rugged and dapper eye defence cream is definitely value for money ,bought eye cream hubby absolutely loves first skeptical using like guy would considering fact average guy doesnt really much skin . im glad finally started using though cream put good use hes also happy started using eye area looks really good . no longer puffer skin even compared darkened due sun exposure . rugged dapper eye defence cream definitely value money,"['bought', 'eye', 'cream', 'hubby', 'absolutely', 'loves', 'first', 'skeptical', 'using', 'like', 'guy', 'would', 'considering', 'fact', 'average', 'guy', 'doesnt', 'really', 'much', 'skin', '.', 'im', 'glad', 'finally', 'started', 'using', 'though', 'cream', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'hes', 'also', 'happy', 'started', 'using', 'eye', 'area', 'looks', 'really', 'good', '.', 'no', 'longer', 'puffer', 'skin', 'even', 'compared', 'darkened', 'due', 'sun', 'exposure', '.', 'rugged', 'dapper', 'eye', 'defence', 'cream', 'definitely', 'value', 'money']"

i was hesitant to buy this to be honest. but i got a gift card for a birthday recently and decided id give it a try because who doesnt want to stay looking younger i have been pleasantly surprised. i use it at night before bed and it gives a slight coolingtingling sensation that feels nice. and most importantly it definitely has reduced the undereye darkness. i believe it has also reduced expression lines a bit as well forehead top of nose etc.. now disclaimer i went from using nothing to using this product but after looking at some other products and their price tags this seems like a great deal for an effective product. i may give some of the other rd products a try in the future. great deal for an effective product,hesitant buy honest . got gift card birthday recently decided id give try doesnt want stay looking younger pleasantly surprised . use night bed gives slight coolingtingling sensation feels nice . importantly definitely reduced undereye darkness . believe also reduced expression lines bit well forehead top nose etc .. disclaimer went using nothing using product looking products price tags seems like great deal effective product . may give rd products try future . great deal effective product,"['hesitant', 'buy', 'honest', '.', 'got', 'gift', 'card', 'birthday', 'recently', 'decided', 'id', 'give', 'try', 'doesnt', 'want', 'stay', 'looking', 'younger', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', '.', 'use', 'night', 'bed', 'gives', 'slight', 'coolingtingling', 'sensation', 'feels', 'nice', '.', 'importantly', 'definitely', 'reduced', 'undereye', 'darkness', '.', 'believe', 'also', 'reduced', 'expression', 'lines', 'bit', 'well', 'forehead', 'top', 'nose', 'etc', '..', 'disclaimer', 'went', 'using', 'nothing', 'using', 'product', 'looking', 'products', 'price', 'tags', 'seems', 'like', 'great', 'deal', 'effective', 'product', '.', 'may', 'give', 'rd', 'products', 'try', 'future', '.', 'great', 'deal', 'effective', 'product']"
ive been using this cream for a few years as a cream base for revlons revitalift 1.5 hyaluronic acid serum. really helps with wrinkly eyes but you still must get the requisite hours of sleep at least 6.5 to 7 hours for me for it to work noticeably well.additionally heres how to tell if you have a legitimate product. the lot number on the box yes there should be a box should exactly match the lot number on the jar. the jar itself is ceramiccolored glass and heavy. the top is plastic and can have some messiness of the red border on top but not much  basically its not a perfect imprint of the red border. there is a clear tab on the back label that you can either pierce or pull down in order to open the jar.there is no longer a plastic coverlid sealing the product when you remove the top lid anymore. ive bought this product at regular retail stores  not through amazon or third parties  and it just isnt there. the top lid may or may not have the cream on it depending on how it is shipped. if its through amazon im sure it gets tossed a bit and may show an air bubble inside with a large dollop of product on the lid. cream should be white and thick and have a slight odor but not strong  should not be sour smelling.its possible all of this can be true and the jar may have still been opened andor used. if thats a concern stick to retail stores and pay extra for the peace of mind. works well with revitalift 1.5 hyaluronic acid serum when legitimate heres how to tell,ive using cream years cream base revlons revitalift 1.5 hyaluronic acid serum . really helps wrinkly eyes still must get requisite hours sleep least 6.5 7 hours work noticeably well.additionally heres tell legitimate product . lot number box yes box exactly match lot number jar . jar ceramiccolored glass heavy . top plastic messiness red border top not much basically not perfect imprint red border . clear tab back label either pierce pull order open jar.there no longer plastic coverlid sealing product remove top lid anymore . ive bought product regular retail stores not amazon third parties isnt . top lid may may not cream depending shipped . amazon im sure gets tossed bit may show air bubble inside large dollop product lid . cream white thick slight odor not strong not sour smelling.its possible true jar may still opened andor used . thats concern stick retail stores pay extra peace mind . works well revitalift 1.5 hyaluronic acid serum legitimate heres tell,"['ive', 'using', 'cream', 'years', 'cream', 'base', 'revlons', 'revitalift', '1.5', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'serum', '.', 'really', 'helps', 'wrinkly', 'eyes', 'still', 'must', 'get', 'requisite', 'hours', 'sleep', 'least', '6.5', '7', 'hours', 'work', 'noticeably', 'well.additionally', 'heres', 'tell', 'legitimate', 'product', '.', 'lot', 'number', 'box', 'yes', 'box', 'exactly', 'match', 'lot', 'number', 'jar', '.', 'jar', 'ceramiccolored', 'glass', 'heavy', '.', 'top', 'plastic', 'messiness', 'red', 'border', 'top', 'not', 'much', 'basically', 'not', 'perfect', 'imprint', 'red', 'border', '.', 'clear', 'tab', 'back', 'label', 'either', 'pierce', 'pull', 'order', 'open', 'jar.there', 'no', 'longer', 'plastic', 'coverlid', 'sealing', 'product', 'remove', 'top', 'lid', 'anymore', '.', 'ive', 'bought', 'product', 'regular', 'retail', 'stores', 'not', 'amazon', 'third', 'parties', 'isnt', '.', 'top', 'lid', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'cream', 'depending', 'shipped', '.', 'amazon', 'im', 'sure', 'gets', 'tossed', 'bit', 'may', 'show', 'air', 'bubble', 'inside', 'large', 'dollop', 'product', 'lid', '.', 'cream', 'white', 'thick', 'slight', 'odor', 'not', 'strong', 'not', 'sour', 'smelling.its', 'possible', 'true', 'jar', 'may', 'still', 'opened', 'andor', 'used', '.', 'thats', 'concern', 'stick', 'retail', 'stores', 'pay', 'extra', 'peace', 'mind', '.', 'works', 'well', 'revitalift', '1.5', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'serum', 'legitimate', 'heres', 'tell']"

its a great value but im not sure if i can see results or not. it feels initially great when applied because its moisturizing but then is also pretty sticky so you can feel it hours later. i apply this after i do my eye makeup otherwise i would be applying on top of the stickiness and it would be a mess. also do not get this in your eye it will burn for a long time and is not fun. i will still keep using it for the price and because maybe it works or its just a placebo affect and i think i look more awake than i am when i put it on who knows. great value unsure of results,great value im not sure see results not . feels initially great applied moisturizing also pretty sticky feel hours later . apply eye makeup otherwise would applying top stickiness would mess . also not get eye burn long time not fun . still keep using price maybe works placebo affect think look awake put knows . great value unsure results,"['great', 'value', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'see', 'results', 'not', '.', 'feels', 'initially', 'great', 'applied', 'moisturizing', 'also', 'pretty', 'sticky', 'feel', 'hours', 'later', '.', 'apply', 'eye', 'makeup', 'otherwise', 'would', 'applying', 'top', 'stickiness', 'would', 'mess', '.', 'also', 'not', 'get', 'eye', 'burn', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'fun', '.', 'still', 'keep', 'using', 'price', 'maybe', 'works', 'placebo', 'affect', 'think', 'look', 'awake', 'put', 'knows', '.', 'great', 'value', 'unsure', 'results']"

these products have absolutely surpassed my expectations. i have very oily skin thats prone to breakouts and have tried everything under the sun to stop my acne. but the problem is most moisturizers leave my skin feeling and looking really greasy. neutrogenas products have really made oily skin a non factorfor me. my favorites are the hydraulic moisturizer facial scrub and the sunscreen for how fast they dry and the glowing not oily complexion they leave your skin with once you apply them.the wash really leaves my skin with a clean feeling without feeling dry. when i first started using it i had a few spots on my face that were turning into large pimples and this stuff completely reversed them.the moisturizer is really gellike and dry upon application making it easy to apply the nonoil sunscreen which does the same thing. keeps my face dry and ive noticed that alot of finelines that i used to have are gone. the night time cream is very solid as well. the eye cream is great too. im only 24 so i dont really have bags under my eyes but its definitely made my undereyes alot smoother. this is definitely a good investment.before using neutrogena i used lumin for a few months. their products are decent too but they dont cater to oily skin types as well as neutrogena does so their formulas didnt help me much with oil and i still had small breakouts from having so much oil on my face. plus its more expensive. not trying to bash lumin but thats just my honest comparison.overall 55 and would definitely recommend over other competitors ,products absolutely surpassed expectations . oily skin thats prone breakouts tried everything sun stop acne . problem moisturizers leave skin feeling looking really greasy . neutrogenas products really made oily skin non factorfor . favorites hydraulic moisturizer facial scrub sunscreen fast dry glowing not oily complexion leave skin apply them.the wash really leaves skin clean feeling without feeling dry . first started using spots face turning large pimples stuff completely reversed them.the moisturizer really gellike dry upon application making easy apply nonoil sunscreen thing . keeps face dry ive noticed alot finelines used gone . night time cream solid well . eye cream great . im 24 dont really bags eyes definitely made undereyes alot smoother . definitely good investment.before using neutrogena used lumin months . products decent dont cater oily skin types well neutrogena formulas didnt help much oil still small breakouts much oil face . plus expensive . not trying bash lumin thats honest comparison.overall 55 would definitely recommend competitors,"['products', 'absolutely', 'surpassed', 'expectations', '.', 'oily', 'skin', 'thats', 'prone', 'breakouts', 'tried', 'everything', 'sun', 'stop', 'acne', '.', 'problem', 'moisturizers', 'leave', 'skin', 'feeling', 'looking', 'really', 'greasy', '.', 'neutrogenas', 'products', 'really', 'made', 'oily', 'skin', 'non', 'factorfor', '.', 'favorites', 'hydraulic', 'moisturizer', 'facial', 'scrub', 'sunscreen', 'fast', 'dry', 'glowing', 'not', 'oily', 'complexion', 'leave', 'skin', 'apply', 'them.the', 'wash', 'really', 'leaves', 'skin', 'clean', 'feeling', 'without', 'feeling', 'dry', '.', 'first', 'started', 'using', 'spots', 'face', 'turning', 'large', 'pimples', 'stuff', 'completely', 'reversed', 'them.the', 'moisturizer', 'really', 'gellike', 'dry', 'upon', 'application', 'making', 'easy', 'apply', 'nonoil', 'sunscreen', 'thing', '.', 'keeps', 'face', 'dry', 'ive', 'noticed', 'alot', 'finelines', 'used', 'gone', '.', 'night', 'time', 'cream', 'solid', 'well', '.', 'eye', 'cream', 'great', '.', 'im', '24', 'dont', 'really', 'bags', 'eyes', 'definitely', 'made', 'undereyes', 'alot', 'smoother', '.', 'definitely', 'good', 'investment.before', 'using', 'neutrogena', 'used', 'lumin', 'months', '.', 'products', 'decent', 'dont', 'cater', 'oily', 'skin', 'types', 'well', 'neutrogena', 'formulas', 'didnt', 'help', 'much', 'oil', 'still', 'small', 'breakouts', 'much', 'oil', 'face', '.', 'plus', 'expensive', '.', 'not', 'trying', 'bash', 'lumin', 'thats', 'honest', 'comparison.overall', '55', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'competitors']"

im a 38 yearold man and i tried to put a lot of research into eye creams and based on reviews and price i ordered this one. i began using it at the end of september 23 and its now december 23. around the 6 week mark i started getting compliments three to be exact from different people asking me what i was doing differently and how my face seemed to look healthier. a little embarrassing as i wasnt aware it didnt before. i could also tell there was a difference in firmness of the skin around my eyes and the dark circles i had for years began to soften. they havent disappeared but the improvement was significant enough for three people to comment on. i am now a fan of this product and just reordered another tube. this tube lasted about three months with both morning and night use. i will continue to use twice a day small amounts. if youre on the fence go for it but use consistently and be patient at least six weeks for me to notice a big difference. works on dark circles and bags,im 38 yearold man tried put lot research eye creams based reviews price ordered one . began using end september 23 december 23. around 6 week mark started getting compliments three exact different people asking differently face seemed look healthier . little embarrassing wasnt aware didnt . could also tell difference firmness skin around eyes dark circles years began soften . havent disappeared improvement significant enough three people comment . fan product reordered another tube . tube lasted three months morning night use . continue use twice day small amounts . youre fence go use consistently patient least six weeks notice big difference . works dark circles bags,"['im', '38', 'yearold', 'man', 'tried', 'put', 'lot', 'research', 'eye', 'creams', 'based', 'reviews', 'price', 'ordered', 'one', '.', 'began', 'using', 'end', 'september', '23', 'december', '23.', 'around', '6', 'week', 'mark', 'started', 'getting', 'compliments', 'three', 'exact', 'different', 'people', 'asking', 'differently', 'face', 'seemed', 'look', 'healthier', '.', 'little', 'embarrassing', 'wasnt', 'aware', 'didnt', '.', 'could', 'also', 'tell', 'difference', 'firmness', 'skin', 'around', 'eyes', 'dark', 'circles', 'years', 'began', 'soften', '.', 'havent', 'disappeared', 'improvement', 'significant', 'enough', 'three', 'people', 'comment', '.', 'fan', 'product', 'reordered', 'another', 'tube', '.', 'tube', 'lasted', 'three', 'months', 'morning', 'night', 'use', '.', 'continue', 'use', 'twice', 'day', 'small', 'amounts', '.', 'youre', 'fence', 'go', 'use', 'consistently', 'patient', 'least', 'six', 'weeks', 'notice', 'big', 'difference', '.', 'works', 'dark', 'circles', 'bags']"

i am 75 years old and for a number of years have had bags and circles under my eyes. i have tried a number of products that were supposed to help reduce these problems with little to no results. i decided to try this eye cream because of tv ads and i was familiar with the brand.generally i allow similar products 6090 days to judge results but after 6 weeks of using this product morning and evening i thought the bags looked smaller. i took a current picture of me and found a photo of me from 4 years ago. i was blown away by the difference. even though i was wearing no eye makeup in the current picture i looked years younger without the bags under my eyes.even though the swelling under my eyes isnt completely gone i feel continued use of the eye cream will further reduce the swelling that is left. i should also mention that i am wearing no makeup at all in the 2022 picture. i would definitely recommend this eye cream and hope that it works for you as it has for me.i hope this review was helpful for you. nothing tells the story like pictures. my eyebags of many years are going away.,75 years old number years bags circles eyes . tried number products supposed help reduce problems little no results . decided try eye cream tv ads familiar brand.generally allow similar products 6090 days judge results 6 weeks using product morning evening thought bags looked smaller . took current picture found photo 4 years ago . blown away difference . even though wearing no eye makeup current picture looked years younger without bags eyes.even though swelling eyes isnt completely gone feel continued use eye cream reduce swelling left . also mention wearing no makeup 2022 picture . would definitely recommend eye cream hope works me.i hope review helpful . nothing tells story like pictures . eyebags many years going away .,"['75', 'years', 'old', 'number', 'years', 'bags', 'circles', 'eyes', '.', 'tried', 'number', 'products', 'supposed', 'help', 'reduce', 'problems', 'little', 'no', 'results', '.', 'decided', 'try', 'eye', 'cream', 'tv', 'ads', 'familiar', 'brand.generally', 'allow', 'similar', 'products', '6090', 'days', 'judge', 'results', '6', 'weeks', 'using', 'product', 'morning', 'evening', 'thought', 'bags', 'looked', 'smaller', '.', 'took', 'current', 'picture', 'found', 'photo', '4', 'years', 'ago', '.', 'blown', 'away', 'difference', '.', 'even', 'though', 'wearing', 'no', 'eye', 'makeup', 'current', 'picture', 'looked', 'years', 'younger', 'without', 'bags', 'eyes.even', 'though', 'swelling', 'eyes', 'isnt', 'completely', 'gone', 'feel', 'continued', 'use', 'eye', 'cream', 'reduce', 'swelling', 'left', '.', 'also', 'mention', 'wearing', 'no', 'makeup', '2022', 'picture', '.', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'eye', 'cream', 'hope', 'works', 'me.i', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful', '.', 'nothing', 'tells', 'story', 'like', 'pictures', '.', 'eyebags', 'many', 'years', 'going', 'away', '.']"

in my 56 years this is the first roc product ive tried. i bought it for the price point not crazy expensive like some serums. my skin looks pretty good for my age thanks to good genes and disliking the suns intense heatminimizing sun damage. as we age our eyes retreat and sink further in to our orbital bones giving the appearance of shadows and depth where its not wanted.  our eyelids travel downward and become crepey. and living in the southeast im in a location where everything blooms and causes allergies and eye puffiness. this product promised to help with dark circles firming texture and puffiness so i thought id try it.  i should have used more caution with my sensitive skin. it stings for several hours after i apply it. i attribute that to the synthetic cocktail that it is although some natural products can sting also. but does it work meh. ive been using it for a few weeks and while i didnt expect a miracle i see no difference. i have been using an allergy friendly natural brand of skin care that has been amazing but is midrange pricey and i didnt want to splurge on their eye serum.  now that ive tried the cheaper alternative ive learned my lesson and will just spend double the money on my tried and true favorite brand. i have been using this roc faithfully for several weeks but see absolutely no difference in the dark circles texture or fine lines around my eyes. its just not worth the sting to me. i wish amazon had half stars for rating. 4 seems generous 3 seems harsh. 3.5 stars seems about right. ,56 years first roc product ive tried . bought price point not crazy expensive like serums . skin looks pretty good age thanks good genes disliking suns intense heatminimizing sun damage . age eyes retreat sink orbital bones giving appearance shadows depth not wanted . eyelids travel downward become crepey . living southeast im location everything blooms causes allergies eye puffiness . product promised help dark circles firming texture puffiness thought id try . used caution sensitive skin . stings several hours apply . attribute synthetic cocktail although natural products sting also . work meh . ive using weeks didnt expect miracle see no difference . using allergy friendly natural brand skin care amazing midrange pricey didnt want splurge eye serum . ive tried cheaper alternative ive learned lesson spend double money tried true favorite brand . using roc faithfully several weeks see absolutely no difference dark circles texture fine lines around eyes . not worth sting . wish amazon half stars rating . 4 seems generous 3 seems harsh . 3.5 stars seems right .,"['56', 'years', 'first', 'roc', 'product', 'ive', 'tried', '.', 'bought', 'price', 'point', 'not', 'crazy', 'expensive', 'like', 'serums', '.', 'skin', 'looks', 'pretty', 'good', 'age', 'thanks', 'good', 'genes', 'disliking', 'suns', 'intense', 'heatminimizing', 'sun', 'damage', '.', 'age', 'eyes', 'retreat', 'sink', 'orbital', 'bones', 'giving', 'appearance', 'shadows', 'depth', 'not', 'wanted', '.', 'eyelids', 'travel', 'downward', 'become', 'crepey', '.', 'living', 'southeast', 'im', 'location', 'everything', 'blooms', 'causes', 'allergies', 'eye', 'puffiness', '.', 'product', 'promised', 'help', 'dark', 'circles', 'firming', 'texture', 'puffiness', 'thought', 'id', 'try', '.', 'used', 'caution', 'sensitive', 'skin', '.', 'stings', 'several', 'hours', 'apply', '.', 'attribute', 'synthetic', 'cocktail', 'although', 'natural', 'products', 'sting', 'also', '.', 'work', 'meh', '.', 'ive', 'using', 'weeks', 'didnt', 'expect', 'miracle', 'see', 'no', 'difference', '.', 'using', 'allergy', 'friendly', 'natural', 'brand', 'skin', 'care', 'amazing', 'midrange', 'pricey', 'didnt', 'want', 'splurge', 'eye', 'serum', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'cheaper', 'alternative', 'ive', 'learned', 'lesson', 'spend', 'double', 'money', 'tried', 'true', 'favorite', 'brand', '.', 'using', 'roc', 'faithfully', 'several', 'weeks', 'see', 'absolutely', 'no', 'difference', 'dark', 'circles', 'texture', 'fine', 'lines', 'around', 'eyes', '.', 'not', 'worth', 'sting', '.', 'wish', 'amazon', 'half', 'stars', 'rating', '.', '4', 'seems', 'generous', '3', 'seems', 'harsh', '.', '3.5', 'stars', 'seems', 'right', '.']"

i have basically three brands i use now especially as i age. im 66 soon to be 67. i always used the basic facial cosmetics covergirl  maybelline and loreal.  i decided after reaching my 60s i needed to upgrade i had damaged my skin over the years and began seeing the impact. i began with no.7 i loved the line and noticed the difference in the quality of the actual product itself. then along the way i picked up some of the vichy and roc items.  speechless.the results using these lines all three and i found rotating each day worked like a charm and results are amazing. this was by no means a simple process in buying the products or testing by mixing and matching but the results were well worth my time and costs. over the past sixmonth period ive bought at least 68 products in each line. i know i know expensive but what the heck i decided you only live once and for once i was placing myself at the top of my own priority list. something ive rarely or have ever done. but well worth it for the results archived up to this point and worth every penny. i know i spent well over 500. to 800. dollars but no regrets whatsoever. people ask me what did you do to your face and neck your skin looks great you hardly have any lines. i no longer use makeup no need. i use a drop or two of liquid no.7 cheek  lip color thats it. powder never touches my face any longer its not needed my face has really smoothed out.ive used a top line from paris called predire a nice sized kit cost over 5000.00 i loved the line but cost was unrealistic for my budget. so spending 500.00 to 1000.00 on the stuff im now using is a bargin. plus they work better than the line from paris not sold in the usa.have fun you only have one life and one face. top product for myself.,basically three brands use especially age . im 66 soon 67. always used basic facial cosmetics covergirl maybelline loreal . decided reaching 60s needed upgrade damaged skin years began seeing impact . began no.7 loved line noticed difference quality actual product . along way picked vichy roc items . speechless.the results using lines three found rotating day worked like charm results amazing . no means simple process buying products testing mixing matching results well worth time costs . past sixmonth period ive bought least 68 products line . know know expensive heck decided live placing top priority list . something ive rarely ever done . well worth results archived point worth every penny . know spent well 500. 800. dollars no regrets whatsoever . people ask face neck skin looks great hardly lines . no longer use makeup no need . use drop two liquid no.7 cheek lip color thats . powder never touches face longer not needed face really smoothed out.ive used top line paris called predire nice sized kit cost 5000.00 loved line cost unrealistic budget . spending 500.00 1000.00 stuff im using bargin . plus work better line paris not sold usa.have fun one life one face . top product .,"['basically', 'three', 'brands', 'use', 'especially', 'age', '.', 'im', '66', 'soon', '67.', 'always', 'used', 'basic', 'facial', 'cosmetics', 'covergirl', 'maybelline', 'loreal', '.', 'decided', 'reaching', '60s', 'needed', 'upgrade', 'damaged', 'skin', 'years', 'began', 'seeing', 'impact', '.', 'began', 'no.7', 'loved', 'line', 'noticed', 'difference', 'quality', 'actual', 'product', '.', 'along', 'way', 'picked', 'vichy', 'roc', 'items', '.', 'speechless.the', 'results', 'using', 'lines', 'three', 'found', 'rotating', 'day', 'worked', 'like', 'charm', 'results', 'amazing', '.', 'no', 'means', 'simple', 'process', 'buying', 'products', 'testing', 'mixing', 'matching', 'results', 'well', 'worth', 'time', 'costs', '.', 'past', 'sixmonth', 'period', 'ive', 'bought', 'least', '68', 'products', 'line', '.', 'know', 'know', 'expensive', 'heck', 'decided', 'live', 'placing', 'top', 'priority', 'list', '.', 'something', 'ive', 'rarely', 'ever', 'done', '.', 'well', 'worth', 'results', 'archived', 'point', 'worth', 'every', 'penny', '.', 'know', 'spent', 'well', '500', '.', '800.', 'dollars', 'no', 'regrets', 'whatsoever', '.', 'people', 'ask', 'face', 'neck', 'skin', 'looks', 'great', 'hardly', 'lines', '.', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'makeup', 'no', 'need', '.', 'use', 'drop', 'two', 'liquid', 'no.7', 'cheek', 'lip', 'color', 'thats', '.', 'powder', 'never', 'touches', 'face', 'longer', 'not', 'needed', 'face', 'really', 'smoothed', 'out.ive', 'used', 'top', 'line', 'paris', 'called', 'predire', 'nice', 'sized', 'kit', 'cost', '5000.00', 'loved', 'line', 'cost', 'unrealistic', 'budget', '.', 'spending', '500.00', '1000.00', 'stuff', 'im', 'using', 'bargin', '.', 'plus', 'work', 'better', 'line', 'paris', 'not', 'sold', 'usa.have', 'fun', 'one', 'life', 'one', 'face', '.', 'top', 'product', '.']"

this is the holy grail for a low end eye cream that works i have a dark under eye area.like the whole under eye.and have tried too many eye creams to count. came across this years ago got complacent and decided to try others. what a mistake. finally found this again and dont plan to leave.heres how i use it apply a thin layer of roc multi correxion 5 in 1 all over the eye area wait a few minutes and pat excess off. apply tiny dots of it bye bye undereye around the eye socket then work it up into the dark area. add a little more if necessary. finish with nyx translucent pressed powder again pressing with makeup sponge around the outer eye socket area concentrating on the outer edge. the brightness draws the attention away from the under eye and out to the bright.i personally have never been able to be completely rid of dark circles its genetic. so for me this eye cream does not erase dark circles it just relieves them but it relieves them better than anything else ive tried to date. i recommend it. best under eye cream,holy grail low end eye cream works dark eye area.like whole eye.and tried many eye creams count . came across years ago got complacent decided try others . mistake . finally found dont plan leave.heres use apply thin layer roc multi correxion 5 1 eye area wait minutes pat excess . apply tiny dots bye bye undereye around eye socket work dark area . add little necessary . finish nyx translucent pressed powder pressing makeup sponge around outer eye socket area concentrating outer edge . brightness draws attention away eye bright.i personally never able completely rid dark circles genetic . eye cream not erase dark circles relieves relieves better anything else ive tried date . recommend . best eye cream,"['holy', 'grail', 'low', 'end', 'eye', 'cream', 'works', 'dark', 'eye', 'area.like', 'whole', 'eye.and', 'tried', 'many', 'eye', 'creams', 'count', '.', 'came', 'across', 'years', 'ago', 'got', 'complacent', 'decided', 'try', 'others', '.', 'mistake', '.', 'finally', 'found', 'dont', 'plan', 'leave.heres', 'use', 'apply', 'thin', 'layer', 'roc', 'multi', 'correxion', '5', '1', 'eye', 'area', 'wait', 'minutes', 'pat', 'excess', '.', 'apply', 'tiny', 'dots', 'bye', 'bye', 'undereye', 'around', 'eye', 'socket', 'work', 'dark', 'area', '.', 'add', 'little', 'necessary', '.', 'finish', 'nyx', 'translucent', 'pressed', 'powder', 'pressing', 'makeup', 'sponge', 'around', 'outer', 'eye', 'socket', 'area', 'concentrating', 'outer', 'edge', '.', 'brightness', 'draws', 'attention', 'away', 'eye', 'bright.i', 'personally', 'never', 'able', 'completely', 'rid', 'dark', 'circles', 'genetic', '.', 'eye', 'cream', 'not', 'erase', 'dark', 'circles', 'relieves', 'relieves', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'ive', 'tried', 'date', '.', 'recommend', '.', 'best', 'eye', 'cream']"

the day after i received this serum i applied a few drops under each eye and applied it evenly. the directions said to wait a few minutes for it to take affect and start tightening the skin. i went and watched tv for a few minutes and then came back to check the results in my bathroom mirror. i was shocked ive had dark circles and puffiness under my eyes for many years. ive tried several other creams that claimed they would reduce the dark circles and puffiness but none of them had any effect. well this rapid reduction serum totally removed the dark circles and made all of the puffiness disappear ive been applying it every morning before i leave the house and it lasts the rest of the day. i do go to the gym and sweat a lot everyday but im careful not to wipe the sweat off under my eyes. the sweat does seem to affect it and my eyes do get a little puffy but not even close to what i looked like without the serum. i will definitely be purchasing more before i run out this under eye serum works great,day received serum applied drops eye applied evenly . directions said wait minutes take affect start tightening skin . went watched tv minutes came back check results bathroom mirror . shocked ive dark circles puffiness eyes many years . ive tried several creams claimed would reduce dark circles puffiness none effect . well rapid reduction serum totally removed dark circles made puffiness disappear ive applying every morning leave house lasts rest day . go gym sweat lot everyday im careful not wipe sweat eyes . sweat seem affect eyes get little puffy not even close looked like without serum . definitely purchasing run eye serum works great,"['day', 'received', 'serum', 'applied', 'drops', 'eye', 'applied', 'evenly', '.', 'directions', 'said', 'wait', 'minutes', 'take', 'affect', 'start', 'tightening', 'skin', '.', 'went', 'watched', 'tv', 'minutes', 'came', 'back', 'check', 'results', 'bathroom', 'mirror', '.', 'shocked', 'ive', 'dark', 'circles', 'puffiness', 'eyes', 'many', 'years', '.', 'ive', 'tried', 'several', 'creams', 'claimed', 'would', 'reduce', 'dark', 'circles', 'puffiness', 'none', 'effect', '.', 'well', 'rapid', 'reduction', 'serum', 'totally', 'removed', 'dark', 'circles', 'made', 'puffiness', 'disappear', 'ive', 'applying', 'every', 'morning', 'leave', 'house', 'lasts', 'rest', 'day', '.', 'go', 'gym', 'sweat', 'lot', 'everyday', 'im', 'careful', 'not', 'wipe', 'sweat', 'eyes', '.', 'sweat', 'seem', 'affect', 'eyes', 'get', 'little', 'puffy', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'looked', 'like', 'without', 'serum', '.', 'definitely', 'purchasing', 'run', 'eye', 'serum', 'works', 'great']"
this product is as effective as anything i have seen in reducing wrinkles under your eye.  the only downside is that within a hour or so a powdery layer of white crystals start to form.  the crystals are noticeable.  i was going to return the product and started the process.  then i decided to try a couple of things to see if i could minimize the white crystal formation.  i found that i could put a thin layer of hand lotion over the area and the crystals would not form as much and the eye cream was barely affected by this.  i learned you dont need much of the product to be effective and you get fewer crystals if you keep the amount to a minimum it works quickly to smooth out wrinkles and sagging under eye skin.,product effective anything seen reducing wrinkles eye . downside within hour powdery layer white crystals start form . crystals noticeable . going return product started process . decided try couple things see could minimize white crystal formation . found could put thin layer hand lotion area crystals would not form much eye cream barely affected . learned dont need much product effective get fewer crystals keep amount minimum works quickly smooth wrinkles sagging eye skin .,"['product', 'effective', 'anything', 'seen', 'reducing', 'wrinkles', 'eye', '.', 'downside', 'within', 'hour', 'powdery', 'layer', 'white', 'crystals', 'start', 'form', '.', 'crystals', 'noticeable', '.', 'going', 'return', 'product', 'started', 'process', '.', 'decided', 'try', 'couple', 'things', 'see', 'could', 'minimize', 'white', 'crystal', 'formation', '.', 'found', 'could', 'put', 'thin', 'layer', 'hand', 'lotion', 'area', 'crystals', 'would', 'not', 'form', 'much', 'eye', 'cream', 'barely', 'affected', '.', 'learned', 'dont', 'need', 'much', 'product', 'effective', 'get', 'fewer', 'crystals', 'keep', 'amount', 'minimum', 'works', 'quickly', 'smooth', 'wrinkles', 'sagging', 'eye', 'skin', '.']"
